              <p>Over the years, we have worked on custom user interfaces on a
                variety of platforms including desktops, tablets, mobile apps
                and kiosks. Our fundamental principles of UI design have
                remained the same, whatever the platform is.</p>

                <h3>User centered design </h3>
                Designing for the user is the first and foremost of our
                policies. We design for your targeted users by understanding who
                they are, what they want and how they want it. </div>
              <div  class="col-sm-6 grey-txt">
                <h3>Clarity and simplicity </h3>
                Uncluttered layouts, easy-to-navigate page elements and simple
                and well thought out messaging and labeling are some of the
                practices we fervently follow. </div>
              <div  class="col-sm-6 grey-txt">
                <h3>Consistency </h3>
                We strive for consistency in your messaging by following common
                design elements and by creating and visual language that flows
                uniformly across devices, platforms, communication, design and
                experience. </div>
              <div  class="col-sm-6 grey-txt">
                <h3>Visual hierarchy </h3>
                We bring clear organizing and prioritizing of elements on your
                interfaces by learning the page scanning patterns and by using
                color, contrast, shape, texture, size and orientation of the
                various UI elements. </div>
              <div  class="col-sm-6 grey-txt">
                <h3>Feedback </h3>
                We make sure your UI has clear communication elements to inform
                users on the actions or changes in the screens by strategically
                placing call-to-action elements, location notifications, error
                alerts and other interactive elements to motivate users to take
                the next step. </div>
