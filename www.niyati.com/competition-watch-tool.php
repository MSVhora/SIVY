                  Application</a> to be hosted on the Enterprise Private Store
                integrated with a web-based back office administration tool with
                User Access Privileges. The App had a Product Showcase, a
                Product Comparison Tool with report generation and PDF export
                feature that allowed the sales executives to demonstrate the
                relative benefits of their product against competition, and also
                instantly share the results as a PDF over an email or bluetooth.

                <br>
                Drawing on positive feedback with its pilot implementation in
                Europe, the App was scaled to include multiple countries and
                language versions. </div>
