                <div  class="font-light-25">Designing an effective logo requires
                  more than graphical skills – you need to understand the brand,
                  its customers, competitors and the message you want to convey
                  through the logo.</div>

                Our logo design team in India comprises of advertising and
                branding specialists with over 15 years of experience. We can
                come up with the most engaging logo ideas that help your company
                stand out in the market. <br>
                <br>
                As part of the logo design process, we also develop powerful
                taglines that go well with the positioning of the brand. To
                maintain brand uniformity across your communication, we also
                develop print collateral templates for business cards, letter
                heads, envelops, PowerPoint and Microsoft Word. For advanced
                users, we also produce a logo user guide that would act as handy
                guide on how to use the logo properly across various mediums,
                materials and backgrounds. </div>

                  <br>
                  This is the initial phase where the client briefs us on their
                  requirement. To get better clarity, we usually send out a logo
                  design questionnaire for the client to fill up. </div>

                  <h3>Brand Identity Research</h3>
                  <br>
                  &nbsp;We research the brand’s current positioning and analyze
                  its strengths and weakness. We compare the brand with its
                  competitors. We share the outcome of the research with the
                  client, providing roadmap on how the logo should be
                  positioned. </div>

                  <br>
                  Once the client gives a green signal on our approach, the
                  design team starts developing design mockups. Unlike several
                  other logo design companies, our mockups are fully designed
                  logos and not sketches or scribbles. We present around 6-7
                  initial designs. </div>

                  <h3>Iteration &amp; Finalization</h3>
                  <br>
                  We expect our clients to actively participate in the logo
                  design process and provide constructive feedback on each
                  design option. We get back to the drawing board to rework on
                  the designs based on the feedback. Multiple levels of
                  iterations will be carried out. </div>
