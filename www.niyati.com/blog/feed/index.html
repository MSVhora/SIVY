<p>When does recycling become an act of love? When you give away stuff you own to someone who can really use it. </p>
<p>As part of Shaastra, the reputed annual tech fest at IIT Madras, Niyati helped build the <a title="Pledge A Book Website" href="http://www.pledgeabook-shaastra.org" target="_blank">website for Pledge-a-book</a> campaign, a social initiative from the students at IIT Madras, that helped collect books from patrons to be given to those with limited access to learning resources. </p>
<p>Niyati is proud to be associated with the campaign that propagates the power of learning. After all, promoting continuous learning is what we at Niyati hold close to our hearts.</p>
<p>When a group of young enterprising students from the great institution approached us with their plan to take their year old campaign to the digital medium, we opted in and offered our services pro bono!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1575" alt="Mobile App Development Costs Mobile App Development Costs: 5 must haves " src="http://www.niyati.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Mobile-App-Development-Costs.jpg" width="664" height="286" title="Mobile App Development Costs: 5 must haves " /></p>
<p><strong>Whether you build it in-house or through a professional app development firm, or hire a bunch of premium techies make sure you invest your time and money in these 5 activities.</strong></p>
<p>Businesses today have more than a handful of choices to narrow down on their <a title="Mobile App Development" href="http://www.niyati.com/mobile-app-development.htm">mobile application development</a> vendor. However, with no pricing parity in the market the decision to arrive at a right-pricing strategy is quite challenging. With the options of Rapid Prototyping for an MVP to building a robust full feature App, you have the choice to either go with freelancers or small-to-medium-to big sized mobile app development companies. With no proper guidance or strategic requirements in place, they can either make or break your mobile app, and eventually your mobile-first approach and business strategy.</p>
<p>Starting from a few tens of thousands to over a couple of million dollars, the costs of mobile app development leaves a decision-maker perplexed. So how does one arrive at an acceptable price-point that does justice to your investment in mobility. What qualities in an App Development Vendor would you look out for before signing on the contract? Whatever you decide you, we have picked our 5 must-haves that should go into planning your costs for mobile app development.</p>
<p><strong>1. Rapid Prototyping :</strong> While Rapid Prototyping is great for idea evaluation, contests and workshops, enterprise mobility apps and customer-centric apps with deeper revenue models must spend more quality time addressing usability needs and integrating smarter KPIs to keep competition at bay. Your minimum investment should go into building a functional product to test and understand the missing data links and understand customer needs and preferences. The important thing to remember is that this is not your final shippable product, but this is something you can go to market to test and garner early feedback. The costs for Rapid Prototyping may range anywhere from 5000 to 25000 USD or more depending on the depth of functional features you have in the app.</p>
<p><strong>2. Better UI / UX :</strong> <a title="Mobile UI Design" href="http://www.niyati.com/user-interface-design.htm">User Interface Design</a> and User Experience is key to the success of an app as good UI and UX improves stickiness factor. Users prefer an app that provides them not only an ease of use through intuitive navigation, but also provides them a memorable experience with right messaging, timely alerts and notifications and shareworthy content. Your Mobile App Development company must have communication experts who can draft the content with the right call-to-actions that can sell. UI/UX Design, Testing and implementation requires considerable amount of budget allocation, but with the right design team in place you can be assured of better results.</p>
<p><strong>3. Analytics &amp; BI :</strong> It is important for businesses to gather insights and measure KPIs on the usage of their App as well as learn customer behaviour over a period of time. Through mobile analytics, you can not only get a report on the number of goals and conversions, but also get rich business intelligence and insights on user preferences, locations, device choice and define the scope for improvements. You should look out for integrating your mobile app with your ERP, SAP, CRM and/or SCM wherever required. With the omni-channel concept today, brands have more than just one customer touch-point. So it is imperative to have a system that can provide you with a comprehensive view of your sales and brand performance.</p>
<p><strong>4. App Discovery :</strong> With a million apps hitting the search results it is important to invest in a marketing and promotion activity that helps users discover your app on the store. Your App Development agency should be able to bring to your table an appropriate strategy for users to be able to discover your app. A company with digital marketing expertise providing you content marketing, inbound marketing, growth hacking and viral marketing ideas help you gain a competitive edge. Trust them when they tell you that your App Icon, the Featured Images as well as your App Description Content on your App Store require a revisit.</p>
<p><strong>5. Support for Updates :</strong> With OS version upgrades, newer devices and newer screen sizes, your App is not a one-time solution but requires constant curation. Bringing in incremental innovations and changes to meet customer preferences, address bounce rates or low conversions, improve experience and also increase revenues or brand equity. Partnering with your app development firm on the longer run will help you stay apace with the latest developments in technology and trends that shape the mobility domain.</p>
<p>As a round-up, mobile application development costs matter most when your app is of strategic importance to your business and adds value to your brand equity and bottomlines. When you choose a Mobile Application Development company, look for these pointers to partner with the right firm.</p>

<p>It wasn’t a CSR initiative per se. Rather a small gesture to support a great idea – Class IX students teach English to Class V students through Phonics. Titled HeadStart – this initiative by Vidyarambam Trust handpicked a few 100 students through an English Proficiency Test and then trained them on the use of phonemes. These students (who are called young teachers) in turn impart their learning to students of Class V. Niyati is privileged to be a part of this initiative and support Vidyarambam Trust in promoting this program.</p>
<div id="attachment_1517" style="width: 674px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1517" alt="Pradeep with kids from Vidyarambam A head start to HeadStart!" src="http://www.niyati.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Pradeep-with-kids-from-Vidyarambam.jpg" width="664" height="493" title="A head start to HeadStart!" /><p class="wp-caption-text">K Pradeep with kids from the Vidyarambam School</p></div>
<p>Every one of us at Niyati decided to sponsor 2 students (it just takes Rs.200 per child) and we also designed and developed the promotion video for the launch of the Program apart from other design collateral. This <a title="Whiteboard movie" href="http://www.niyati.com/multimedia-portfolio" target="_blank">whiteboard animation</a> style video, also known as video scribing, was scripted, illustrated and animated in-house. The style used was to help the viewers evangelize the mission of the program and make the message more loud and clear. The Traditional chalk and board method used was to bring in  village schools into focus. Let us know what you think.

<p>Everybody would love to chill, relax and hangout with friends or family, and what other better place than a café! One of our recent projects was to do branding as well as designing a website for a newly launched café chain, with it&#8217;s first outlet at Accra, Ghana. It is one of its kind in Ghana where you have a unique self serve frozen yogurt /weigh and pay concept.</p>
<p>Our first challenge was to come up with an apt name for the café. As the intrinsic nature of this café is to provide quality natural food, we came up with the name Tresence – the short for True Essence.</p>
<p>To define the rich, natural and fresh menu items, a combination of purple and brown color was used in the logo and website. The <a title="Tresence" href="http://www.tresence.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">website</a> is built on <a title="WordPress Website" href="http://www.niyati.com/wordpress-web-design.htm">WordPress Platform</a> and despite being simple, it effectively communicates its concept very well to all the foodies out there.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the exciting projects we recently completed is an extensive branding exercise for Asian Art Gallery, a newly formed organization aimed at promoting artists of Indian origin among art lovers in US and other parts of the world. </p>
<p>We worked closely with the client and came up with several creative brand identity design ideas, which went through a few rounds of iterations. The final logo uses minimalist design elements with a elegant and neat typography.  </p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1345" alt="art gallery branding Branding Services for Asian Art Gallery" src="http://www.niyati.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/art-gallery-branding.jpg" width="664" height="268" title="Branding Services for Asian Art Gallery" /></p>
<p>Apart from the logo design, we also came up with design templates for their print collateral, some of which are listed below. </p>
<p>Business card, Letterhead and Envelop designs:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Authenticity Certificate design:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1347" alt="art gallery collaterals 2 Branding Services for Asian Art Gallery" src="http://www.niyati.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/art-gallery-collaterals-2.jpg" width="664" height="650" title="Branding Services for Asian Art Gallery" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Invite design:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a title="Asian Art Gallery Website" href="http://www.asianartgallery.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">website</a> we developed has picture galleries and brief bio of the artists participating in their latest art exhibition. The CMS powered website is developed in a <a title="responsive design" href="http://www.niyati.com/responsive-web-design.htm">responsive framework</a> so that it loads seamlessly across desktop, mobile and tablet browsers.</p>
