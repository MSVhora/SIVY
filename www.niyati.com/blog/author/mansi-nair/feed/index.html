<p>It wasn’t a CSR initiative per se. Rather a small gesture to support a great idea – Class IX students teach English to Class V students through Phonics. Titled HeadStart – this initiative by Vidyarambam Trust handpicked a few 100 students through an English Proficiency Test and then trained them on the use of phonemes. These students (who are called young teachers) in turn impart their learning to students of Class V. Niyati is privileged to be a part of this initiative and support Vidyarambam Trust in promoting this program.</p>
<div id="attachment_1517" style="width: 674px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1517" alt="Pradeep with kids from Vidyarambam A head start to HeadStart!" src="http://www.niyati.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Pradeep-with-kids-from-Vidyarambam.jpg" width="664" height="493" title="A head start to HeadStart!" /><p class="wp-caption-text">K Pradeep with kids from the Vidyarambam School</p></div>
<p>Every one of us at Niyati decided to sponsor 2 students (it just takes Rs.200 per child) and we also designed and developed the promotion video for the launch of the Program apart from other design collateral. This <a title="Whiteboard movie" href="http://www.niyati.com/multimedia-portfolio" target="_blank">whiteboard animation</a> style video, also known as video scribing, was scripted, illustrated and animated in-house. The style used was to help the viewers evangelize the mission of the program and make the message more loud and clear. The Traditional chalk and board method used was to bring in  village schools into focus. Let us know what you think. And yes, do drop by the website of <a title="Vidyarambam Trust" href="http://www.vidyarambam.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vidyarambam Trust</a> to show us your support as well.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="Tresence" href="http://www.tresence.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1508" alt="cafe website design Café Website Design   Tresence" src="http://www.niyati.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/cafe-website-design.jpg" width="664" height="493" title="Café Website Design   Tresence" /></a></p>
<p>Everybody would love to chill, relax and hangout with friends or family, and what other better place than a café! One of our recent projects was to do branding as well as designing a website for a newly launched café chain, with it&#8217;s first outlet at Accra, Ghana. It is one of its kind in Ghana where you have a unique self serve frozen yogurt /weigh and pay concept.</p>
<p>Our first challenge was to come up with an apt name for the café. As the intrinsic nature of this café is to provide quality natural food, we came up with the name Tresence – the short for True Essence.</p>
<p>To define the rich, natural and fresh menu items, a combination of purple and brown color was used in the logo and website. The <a title="Tresence" href="http://www.tresence.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">website</a> is built on <a title="WordPress Website" href="http://www.niyati.com/wordpress-web-design.htm">WordPress Platform</a> and despite being simple, it effectively communicates its concept very well to all the foodies out there.</p>
