				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the exciting projects we recently completed is an extensive branding exercise for Asian Art Gallery, a newly formed organization aimed at promoting artists of Indian origin among art lovers in US and other parts of the world. </p>
<p>We worked closely with the client and came up with several creative brand identity design ideas, which went through a few rounds of iterations. The final logo uses minimalist design elements with a elegant and neat typography.  </p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1345" alt="art gallery branding Branding Services for Asian Art Gallery" src="http://www.niyati.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/art-gallery-branding.jpg" width="664" height="268" title="Branding Services for Asian Art Gallery" /></p>
<p>Apart from the logo design, we also came up with design templates for their print collateral, some of which are listed below. </p>
<p>Business card, Letterhead and Envelop designs:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1346" alt="art gallery collaterals 1 Branding Services for Asian Art Gallery" src="http://www.niyati.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/art-gallery-collaterals-1.jpg" width="664" height="650" title="Branding Services for Asian Art Gallery" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Authenticity Certificate design:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1347" alt="art gallery collaterals 2 Branding Services for Asian Art Gallery" src="http://www.niyati.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/art-gallery-collaterals-2.jpg" width="664" height="650" title="Branding Services for Asian Art Gallery" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Invite design:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1348" alt="art gallery collaterals 3 Branding Services for Asian Art Gallery" src="http://www.niyati.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/art-gallery-collaterals-3.jpg" width="664" height="650" title="Branding Services for Asian Art Gallery" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a title="Asian Art Gallery Website" href="http://www.asianartgallery.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">website</a> we developed has picture galleries and brief bio of the artists participating in their latest art exhibition. The CMS powered website is developed in a <a title="responsive design" href="http://www.niyati.com/responsive-web-design.htm">responsive framework</a> so that it loads seamlessly across desktop, mobile and tablet browsers.</p>

<p>The internet has opened up a whole new world of marketing opportunities for hotels and businesses in the travel and tourism industry. Traditional ways of marketing hotels are no more effective when your aim is to attract visitors from across the world.</p>
<p>Smart hotel marketers have already chosen internet as their preferred marketing medium. The scalability, cost-effectiveness and faster execution of ideas make the internet just perfect for marketing hotels.</p>
<p>If your hotel business hasn&#8217;t taken the online leap yet, this is the time to do so. Let us explain how you can leverage the internet medium in the best possible manner:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Improved website design: </b></span></p>
<p>Your hotel’s website often creates the first impression of your property to a potential visitor. So it is important that you pull out all stops to ensure that the visitor develops a favorable attitude towards your hotel. This means that your website must have meaningful content, should load fast, have excellent navigation, updated video and photo galleries and even interactive features like virtual tour and location map. Make sure your website layout is uncluttered, elegant and content rich.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Go mobile:</b></span></p>
<p>Mobile device adoption is clearly on the rise and it is vital that your website is also responsive to mobile and tablet devices. Your mobile website needs to be straightforward, so that the most important information is displayed right at the top and unnecessary clutter is avoided. <a title="Responsive Web Design" href="http://www.niyati.com/responsive-web-design.htm">Responsive Web Design</a> technology may be used to ensure that an optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices like desktops, smartphones and tablets. What’s more, even <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.ch/2012/06/recommendations-for-building-smartphone.html" target="_blank">Google recommends</a> responsive websites.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Ride the social media wave:</b></span></p>
<p>The social media movement is here to stay and your hotel can reap all its benefit by establishing a powerful presence on social media channels like Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Google + and YouTube. For example, you can share pictures of your hotel on your hotel’s Pinterest channel which will get repinned by your followers and thus introduce your hotel to more potential visitors. Reputation management is an important factor to be kept in mind while engaging via social media channels.  By creating an active social media campaign on Facebook and Twitter, you can keep people aware of happenings in your hotel and in your region.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Adopt paid advertising:</b></span></p>
<p>If you have the marketing budget or need quick results, don’t forget to include well conceived and positioned paid ads in your online media campaign. Digital advertising services like Google Ads and Facebook Ads offer a variety of advantages like precise targeting and estimation capabilities that traditional ads do not offer. For example, with Google Ads, you can ensure that your ads are displayed at those places where they are likely to be seen by the very people they are targeted at. For example, if your hotel has a golf course, Google can display your ads in websites, blogs and forums that discuss golf, thereby bringing your hotel in front of a targeted crowd.</p>
<p>Digital advertising also offers the facility of re-targeting, i.e., advertising to a consumer who has shown some sort of engagement with the brand, especially when the previous case did not result in a conversion. This way, it becomes possible to leverage on the earlier marketing that took the consumer to the previous brand’s site in the first place and thus, increase chances of a future conversion taking place.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Present yourself on popular travel portals:</b></span></p>
<p>Make sure that your hotel is listed on popular travel portals like TripAdvisor, Expedia, Booking.com, etc. Not only does this help improve your visibility to visitors from across the world, it also helps you tap into the traffic generated by these portals, especially if your hotel is one of the major accommodation facilities in your area.</p>
<p>Make sure your hotel is also listed in <a href="https://www.google.com/hotels" target="_blank">Google Hotels</a>, which is currently being majorly promoted by Google.</p>
<p>If your hotel is known for its restaurants, make sure they are listed on leading restaurant review sites like Yelp.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Reviews:</b></span></p>
<p>For every hotel, getting positive reviews on travel portals and social channels is extremely important. Make sure you take every effort in getting positive, descriptive feedback from your customers. You can vastly improve your review count with simple steps like sending a thank you note to the customer with direct links to the review pages and specifically requesting them to post their experience.</p>
<p>Make sure to check back regularly on your review pages and respond to any negative comments quickly and compassionately.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Local optimization:</b> </span></p>
<p>When Google detects that your search query carries local intent, it provides a list of business listings relating to your query that are located near you. For example, if you search for “hotels in New York”, Google will give you business listings of popular hotels in New York along with their NPA (name, phone number and address).  It is important that you optimize local search to the fullest extent as it gives you a significant advantage over other bigger hotels. Let’s put it like this- the bigger hotels may have a bigger website and the best SEO tactics in place, but your location will give you the edge that you need to make sure that the user zeroes in on your hotel.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Video optimization:</b></span></p>
<p>In order to improve your site’s visibility online, you can upload videos of your hotel and its offerings to your site which not only give your potential visitors a better idea of the overall décor of your hotel and the services offered, but also help bring more visitors to your site by the use of appropriate SEO tactics. For example, you can upload a few videos to YouTube and attach a few links to your hotel’s website. This way, if the user likes what he sees in the video, he can conveniently click on the link and be taken to your website. <b></b></p>
<p>In addition, if your hotel is based in a city that is a popular tourist spot, you can take videos of the tourist attractions in your city and upload them to your hotel website, thus promoting your hotel indirectly.</p>
<p>If your website includes streaming videos, don’t forget to employ effective video optimization tactics, including having a video sitemap.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><b>E-commerce integration: </b></span></p>
<p>Make sure to make the online booking facility in your hotel website simple, seamless and secure. <a title="Online Booking" href="http://www.niyati.com/e-commerce-services.htm">Online booking</a> is a very convenient way for visitors to book their stay with minimum effort on their part. A large chunk of hotel bookings nowadays is made online and you need to ensure that you don’t lose out on this promising opportunity to increase hotel occupancy.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Marketing through external blogs:</b></span></p>
<p>External blog marketing can be of many types: either you place ads on blogs relevant to your subject, or you could write guest posts on other influential travel blogs. From a hotel’s point of view, it makes sense to place ads for your hotel on popular hotel blogs. As a respected hotelier, you can even offer to write a guest post on a popular hotel blog in which you may give your views about the hospitality industry. While writing your guest post, don’t forget to include a link to your hotel website!<b> </b>You can also reach out to popular bloggers to mention or review your hotel on their blogs. An approval by a respected and popular blogger can translate into a significantly higher number of visitors.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Email marketing:</b></span></p>
<p>Creating a robust email database of your customers is an excellent way to stay in touch with them and let them know about new offers at your hotel. Another excellent tactic would be to send them creatively designed e-cards on special occasions like birthday, anniversary or during religious festivals.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Conclusion: </b></span></p>
<p>The above are some of the tactics that will go a great way in enhancing your hotel&#8217;s online presence. What is important is to use the internet medium effectively by keeping your audience consistently engaged in a creative, honest way. This will not just improve your hotel&#8217;s reputation online, but encourage visitors to recommend your hotel to their peers.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1273" title="Tips to Get Website Indexed" alt="Tips Website Not Getting Indexed? Here’s What You Need to Check" src="http://www.niyati.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Tips.jpg" width="664" height="286" /></p>
<p>The whole point of having a website is to make it visible across the web and appeal to target visitors. If your website is not indexed, it won’t appear in the search results and this defeats the purpose for which it was created in the first place. There might be a lot of reasons behind search engines not indexing your website. Here is the checklist of common problems related to site indexing and the solutions to fix them.<br /> </p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: large">Robots.txt</span></strong></p>
<p>Robots.txt, if present, is the first thing that a search engine bot looks up when visiting your website. It is used by webmasters to provide instructions to the search engine bots visiting a site. If your robots.txt file carried instructions to discourage search engine crawling, your site may not get indexed. You can check your site’s robots file by adding <em>/robots.txt</em> at the end of your domain name.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class=" wp-image-1281 aligncenter" title="Robots File Tag" alt="robots tag Website Not Getting Indexed? Here’s What You Need to Check" src="http://www.niyati.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/robots-tag.jpg" width="96" height="44" /></p>
<p>If you see the above instruction in your robots.txt file, it means that the search engine bots are discouraged from crawling your site’s content. You can fix this issue easily by removing the ‘/’ from this command. You can use the robots.txt file effectively to de-index specific folders in your site. <a title="Google's Robots.txt File" href="http://www.google.com/robots.txt" target="_blank">Google’s very own robots file</a> has covered an extensive list of commands. Check it out for your reference.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large"><b>Meta Tags</b></span></p>
<p><b></b>It is a common practice by webmasters to use meta ‘robots’ tag to prevent search engine bots from crawling a particular web page. If a particular page in your website doesn’t get indexed, check its source code for this meta tag:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class=" wp-image-1278 aligncenter" title="meta no follow tag" alt="meta no follow tag Website Not Getting Indexed? Here’s What You Need to Check" src="http://www.niyati.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/meta-no-follow-tag.jpg" width="333" height="27" /></p>
<p>This tag will prevent the web page from being crawled by the search engine bots. Some WordPress themes incorporate this meta tag by default. If your WP site has indexing problems, it is worth checking the theme header for this tag. Once this tag is removed from the source code, search engine bots can crawl the particular web page.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large"><b>Sitemap Errors</b></span></p>
<p>A sitemap (XML or HTML) provides a search engine robot with the list of URLs to be crawled in your website. If for some reasons the sitemap in your website is not automatically updated, search engine bots may some time to discover those webpages and this would cause delay in indexing.</p>
<p>You need to check out the Webmaster tool (set up a Google Webmaster account for your site if you don’t already have it) for issues related to the sitemap. The Sitemap Details page will inform you about the errors in it. Once the errors are fixed, you can <a title="Sitemap Generator" href="http://www.xml-sitemaps.com/" target="_blank">generate a new xml sitemap</a> for your site and upload it in the root for your website.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large"><b>Other Crawling Errors</b></span></p>
<p>Once you’ve ruled out the above mentioned problems, head to your Google Webmaster Tools dashboard and check for crawling errors. The crawling errors need to be fixed as and when you see them. Some of the page crawling errors might be related <a title="URL Parameter" href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/1235687?hl=en" target="_blank">URL parameter</a> issues, which mostly happen in the case of dynamic links. You can fix errors like this by using a simple 301 redirect.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large"><b>Getting Indexed Under a Different Domain Name</b></span></p>
<p>Before coming to a conclusion that your website is not indexed, check out for other variations in your domain name that might have been indexed by search engines. For instance, http://www.yoursite.com and http://yoursite.com might look similar to you. However, they are two different URLs according to the search engines.</p>
<p>If you website is indexed in a different name than the one you preferred, you need to specify your preferred domain name in the Webmaster tools and use a <a title="301 Redirect" href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/93633" target="_blank">301 redirect</a>. You can also use <a title="Canonical Link Element" href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/139394?hl=en" target="_blank">canonical link element</a> for setting the most preferred URL version but a 301 redirect is more effective.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large"><b>No Incoming Links</b></span></p>
<p>This issue is common in websites that are new to the web. If your website doesn’t have any incoming links from other websites, it might take a while for Google to find your site. If you wish to get your site indexed soon, you may have to build some backlinks manually. Backlinks from high PR websites will provide more link weightage to your website thereby helping it get indexed soon.</p>
<p>Submitting your site to Google Plus will earn you an incoming link and help your site get discovered by the search engine bots. You can also <a title="Submit to Google" href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/submit-url" target="_blank">submit your site URL to Google</a> through your Webmasters tool. These methods will significantly improve the chances of getting indexed by Google.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large"><b>AJAX Applications</b></span></p>
<p>If your website runs AJAX application, it would contain AJAX URLs (a URL with # fragment) and the content of these URLs can’t be crawled by search engine bots. This, in turn, would prevent the search engines from indexing your website. There is a <a title="AJAX URL Crawling" href="https://developers.google.com/webmasters/ajax-crawling/" target="_blank">separate process</a> to help search engine bots crawl AJAX content. The solution provided by Google Developers will help you fix this issue.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large"><b>Bad Links &amp; Google Reconsideration Request</b></span></p>
<p>It is important for a site owner to constantly assess the quality of incoming links. The inbound links to your website should not violate <a title="Google's Guidelines" href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/35769#3" target="_blank">Google’s guidelines</a> on link quality. You can detect these bad links through your Google Webmaster Tools. If your site has too many bad links, it will be de-indexed by Google and other search engines.</p>
<p>If by any chance your website has been de-indexed due to this issue, you need to <a title="Disavow Bad Links" href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/2648487?hl=en" target="_blank">disavow</a> these bad links completely and make sure that your site no longer violates the guidelines. Once this is fixed, you need to submit a reconsideration request to Google through your Webmaster tools.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large"><b>SEO Spamming</b></span></p>
<p>There are many black hat SEO techniques practiced by spammers to get higher rankings instantly. Google constantly keeps tab of its search results quality and takes <a title="Google's Manual Action" href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/2604824" target="_blank">manual action</a> on sites that employ spamming techniques. Shortcut methods like cloaking, keyword stuffing, content scraping and spam links etc. will get your site permanently de-indexed.</p>
<p>The simple solution here is to clean up your site of all the spamming techniques and submit a <a title="Reconsideration Request" href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/35843?hl=en" target="_blank">reconsideration request</a> through your Webmaster tools.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large"><b>Malware Ridden Websites</b></span></p>
<p>Websites infected with malwares may get disappeared from search results very soon. The silver lining here is that you can find the issue before your site gets de-indexed. Google Webmaster Tools will issue a warning that your site has been compromised. Once you’ve discovered the issue, you can remove the malware and enhance your site’s security. You can also submit a reconsideration request if your site has already been de-indexed.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large"><b>Website Downtime</b></span></p>
<p>If your website is continuously down for a significant period (say a few weeks) of time, it might get de-indexed from the search engines. The only solution here is to fix the issue causing downtime and get your site back online. Once your site is back online, it may take a while to get your traffic back to its normal status. If your site isn’t indexed even after fixing the issue, you may have to submit the reconsideration request in the Webmaster Tools.</p>
<p>In addition to the ones listed here, Google has also mentioned a <a title="URLs Not Indexed" href="http://support.google.com/customsearch/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=115963" target="_blank">few more cases</a> in which your site may not get indexed.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large"><strong>Fetch as Google</strong></span></p>
<p>If you believe your website doesn&#8217;t have any of the above issues, here&#8217;s a simple way to get your web page indexed: Log on to your Google Webmaster Tools account and click on &#8216;Fetch as Google&#8217; link under &#8216;Crawl&#8217;. Enter your URL and submit to index. You may see the page indexed on Google within seconds. I do this every time I publish a new blog post and it works like a charm.  </p>
<p>Conclusion:</p>
<p>These are some of the common issues you need to check if your site hasn&#8217;t got indexed.  If you have experienced website indexing issues other than the ones listed here,  feel free to mention it in the comments below.</p>

<p>Welcome to ‘Digital Roundup’, a weekly roundup of the happenings in the digital world. This week’s roundup centers on the dynamic world of technology and the innovations witnessed in it. Be it Apple’s new affinity towards large screens or Google’s new Chromecast dongle, last week’s happenings promise a step ahead in the ever changing technology sphere. Here is a roundup of the biggest events in last week’s digital world.</p>
<p><b>Google Chromecast Unveiled</b></p>
<p><img class="wp-image-1196 alignright" alt="chromecast Digital Roundup – July 22 27, 2013" src="http://www.niyati.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/chromecast.jpg" width="114" height="152" title="Digital Roundup – July 22 27, 2013" />Google launched the <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/chromecast/#netflix" target="_blank">Chromecast</a>, which is expected to revolutionize the world of media streaming. The Google Chromecast is a simple adapter that can be plugged into the HDMI port of a television. Once plugged in and installed, the digital dongle is ready to connect to WiFi and bring all the streaming content that the web has to offer. The Chromecast runs on Chrome OS but it is compatible with devices running on other platforms like Android, iOS and Google Chrome on Windows etc. </p>
<p>This device is priced only $35 for the US market. As an introductory offer, the Chromecast was originally unveiled with a 3 month free subscription to Netflix. The overwhelming demand for Chromecast since its launch has prompted <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/google-shuts-down-chromecasts-free-netflix-offer-after-overwhelming-demand-6C10760643" target="_blank">Google to call off Netflix offer</a>. However, customers who ordered Chromecast before the cancellation of Netflix offer can still get access to the 3-month free subscription.</p>

<p><b>Apple Testing Larger Screens for New Devices</b></p>
<p>Technology giant Apple is reportedly <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323829104578620870597408176.html" target="_blank">testing larger screens</a> for its smartphones and tablets. This is based on the information from Apple’s suppliers. The suppliers say that the Cupertino based company asked for smartphone screens, which are larger than the current iPhone 5 screen.</p>
<p>This move comes as a bid to compete with rivals like Samsung that have exploited the larger screens to their advantage. The research phase is quite usual with Apple and anything conclusive can be determined only after its official announcement.</p>
<p>These are some of the biggest tech news for this week. Let’s hope the next week is as cheerful as this one.</p>
