				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1575" alt="Mobile App Development Costs Mobile App Development Costs: 5 must haves " src="http://www.niyati.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Mobile-App-Development-Costs.jpg" width="664" height="286" title="Mobile App Development Costs: 5 must haves " /></p>
<p><strong>Whether you build it in-house or through a professional app development firm, or hire a bunch of premium techies make sure you invest your time and money in these 5 activities.</strong></p>
<p>Businesses today have more than a handful of choices to narrow down on their <a title="Mobile App Development" href="http://www.niyati.com/mobile-app-development.htm">mobile application development</a> vendor. However, with no pricing parity in the market the decision to arrive at a right-pricing strategy is quite challenging. With the options of Rapid Prototyping for an MVP to building a robust full feature App, you have the choice to either go with freelancers or small-to-medium-to big sized mobile app development companies. With no proper guidance or strategic requirements in place, they can either make or break your mobile app, and eventually your mobile-first approach and business strategy.</p>
<p>Starting from a few tens of thousands to over a couple of million dollars, the costs of mobile app development leaves a decision-maker perplexed. So how does one arrive at an acceptable price-point that does justice to your investment in mobility. What qualities in an App Development Vendor would you look out for before signing on the contract? Whatever you decide you, we have picked our 5 must-haves that should go into planning your costs for mobile app development.</p>
<p><strong>1. Rapid Prototyping :</strong> While Rapid Prototyping is great for idea evaluation, contests and workshops, enterprise mobility apps and customer-centric apps with deeper revenue models must spend more quality time addressing usability needs and integrating smarter KPIs to keep competition at bay. Your minimum investment should go into building a functional product to test and understand the missing data links and understand customer needs and preferences. The important thing to remember is that this is not your final shippable product, but this is something you can go to market to test and garner early feedback. The costs for Rapid Prototyping may range anywhere from 5000 to 25000 USD or more depending on the depth of functional features you have in the app.</p>
<p><strong>2. Better UI / UX :</strong> <a title="Mobile UI Design" href="http://www.niyati.com/user-interface-design.htm">User Interface Design</a> and User Experience is key to the success of an app as good UI and UX improves stickiness factor. Users prefer an app that provides them not only an ease of use through intuitive navigation, but also provides them a memorable experience with right messaging, timely alerts and notifications and shareworthy content. Your Mobile App Development company must have communication experts who can draft the content with the right call-to-actions that can sell. UI/UX Design, Testing and implementation requires considerable amount of budget allocation, but with the right design team in place you can be assured of better results.</p>
<p><strong>3. Analytics &amp; BI :</strong> It is important for businesses to gather insights and measure KPIs on the usage of their App as well as learn customer behaviour over a period of time. Through mobile analytics, you can not only get a report on the number of goals and conversions, but also get rich business intelligence and insights on user preferences, locations, device choice and define the scope for improvements. You should look out for integrating your mobile app with your ERP, SAP, CRM and/or SCM wherever required. With the omni-channel concept today, brands have more than just one customer touch-point. So it is imperative to have a system that can provide you with a comprehensive view of your sales and brand performance.</p>
<p><strong>4. App Discovery :</strong> With a million apps hitting the search results it is important to invest in a marketing and promotion activity that helps users discover your app on the store. Your App Development agency should be able to bring to your table an appropriate strategy for users to be able to discover your app. A company with digital marketing expertise providing you content marketing, inbound marketing, growth hacking and viral marketing ideas help you gain a competitive edge. Trust them when they tell you that your App Icon, the Featured Images as well as your App Description Content on your App Store require a revisit.</p>
<p><strong>5. Support for Updates :</strong> With OS version upgrades, newer devices and newer screen sizes, your App is not a one-time solution but requires constant curation. Bringing in incremental innovations and changes to meet customer preferences, address bounce rates or low conversions, improve experience and also increase revenues or brand equity. Partnering with your app development firm on the longer run will help you stay apace with the latest developments in technology and trends that shape the mobility domain.</p>
<p>As a round-up, mobile application development costs matter most when your app is of strategic importance to your business and adds value to your brand equity and bottomlines. When you choose a Mobile Application Development company, look for these pointers to partner with the right firm.</p>

<p>Chennai&#8217;s newest Western Music School &#8211; Academy of Western Music has a cool new website. Yet another enterprising initiative from the Nippon Group, who also owns the Yamaha Music Square showroom, the Academy aims to offer world-class music education and certification from Trinity College, London. For those who love Rock, the Academy has specialized courses on Rock Syllabus by the International Rock Music Exam Board &#8211; RockSchool.</p>
<p>When the Academy approached Niyati.com for its official website design, we recommended to go in for a <a title="Responsive Web Design, India" href="http://www.niyati.com/responsive-web-design.htm" target="_blank">Responsive Design</a> to make the website device agnostic. We knew that designing for mobile was an important step in building a brand presence online. As today&#8217;s generation have access to the latest smart phones and spend a considerable amount of time going social on their mobile, we believed that the website needs to adapt easily to smart phones as much as it does to tablets and PCs. The Responsive Web Design Team at Niyati had to go through several rounds of code checks and iterations testing it across iOS and Android Phones, as well as on iPad. But all the hardwork and efforts paid off with the end result &#8211; <a title="Academy of Western Music, Chennai" href="http://www.awmchennai.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.awmchennai.com</a></p>
<p>So folks who are keen to learn music within a world-class ambience, and with access to the latest music instruments and experienced tutors, may we recommend you to visit the Academy of Western Music at Santhome, Chennai. And yes, do check them out by logging on to their website on your phone.</p>

<p>Our young generation lives and breathes digital. It’s like that old joke saying, “I was not born. I was downloaded.” So with much happening in the digital space in the country, it is but important for businesses and their websites to live up to (or rather surpass) the expectations of the average user (the viewer). Everybody has got talking on SoLoMo (Social, Local and Mobile), but then are businesses prepared to delve deeper? Do they have the resources in place to handle the new media demands? We take a look at a few important trends to watch out for that will perhaps shape up the digital cloud nine in the country.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Responsive is the way to go.</strong> Do you want your website to be device agnostic? Check out our <a href="/responsive-web-design.htm">responsive web design services</a>. Website designers will soon have to catch-up and adapt to<a title="responsive web design" href="/responsive-web-design.htm"> responsive design</a> practices to offer businesses the best of all worlds when it comes to <a title="Website Application Development" href="/web-application-development.htm">website development</a> – be it for viewing on a PC, a Tablet, a Mobile Device or a large screen LED TV. Usability engineers and designers will find navigation a challenge but more innovative approaches are likely to be witnessed in the coming months ahead. With Responsive Navigation, we expect new breakthroughs to happen in mobile advertising and content for search.</li>
<li><strong>App it up.</strong> Sizeable players like Flipkart, Jabong, Quikr, Redbus, Cleartrip and several others made headway in online shopping in 2012. And a number of them have witnessed a chunk of the traffic from mobile users – both via Apps as well as mobile browsers. Thanks to the burgeoning community of mobile internet users, businesses and brands will look to leverage more from the mobile media – via apps, mobile advertising and mobile-friendly websites. Time is also ripe for M-Commerce with mobile apps. While the payment gateway providers in India are still only a hand few (direct players include ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Citibank and Axis Bank, and third-party providers include CCAvenue, TechPro, EBS, Payu), we are expecting PayPal to come back with India-centric products that will be a boon to small businesses.</li>
<li><strong>Video Marketing.</strong> A powerful tool for content marketers and <a title="SEO Services India" href="/search-engine-optimization.htm">SEO</a> analysts working with Online PR, video clips and video advertising is set to be in demand. Brands as well as businesses will make use of short-video clips to popularise or even test-market their product and service offering. One can lean back to the free media on YouTube, Vimeo, and Facebook instead of spending on paid channels. What’s more interesting is the rise HTML5 players that now make video-viewing compatible across iOS devices (earlier Flash based video players were not compatible on an iPhone and iPad).</li>
<li><strong>Hack the Hacker.</strong> While security will continue to be a threat from across all corners, one should expect more hackers to be on the pry. It may not only be defacing a website or robbing data from the database, but something as simple as content hacking also stands a threat to a brand’s visibility and presence online. Designers and developers will look for building solutions to overcome loopholes with decreased dependencies on insecure plug-ins. Thanks to analytics, statcounters and webmaster tools, one can monitor traffic to the website, see deviating trends in traffic and search strings and attend to immediate resolutions in the instance of a script or code injection.</li>
<li><strong>Store them on the cloud.</strong> Hosting service providers are in for a fortune. With the amount of data, not to mention the tens and thousands of kilobyte videos and images out there, cloud storage will gain popularity. Equally integral will be the cloud backup software and cloud backup devices that will help digitization in a big way. What may not change much is the pricing of the Indian Data Centre which still continues to be on the steeply higher side when compared to the global cloud hosting players outside. So we will continue to depend on our foreign friends. Although Hostgator and GoDaddy have started India operations, their data centres are still outside India.</li>
</ol>
<p>To sum up, businesses and their marketing task force have a bigger challenge in hand as their target audience is now more than equipped with the power of choice at their finger-tips. It just takes a click and a swipe to decide on what to buy. So it is important to address your brand’s visibility on the mobile media as much as it should on the digital cloud.</p>

<p>There is an old saying about chasing two hares and catching none. And we know many out there who have done this. Blame it on the sheer enthusiasm to self-learning or the I-know-it-all approach. They end up messing their social media presence. Often in a hurry to create a Facebook presence for their Brand, they end up with a Personal account calling it their official Facebook page. And therefore, the first name and last name becomes the name of the company that has a fictitious date of birth belonging to either the male or female sex. In some cases this Brand also went to a School, Lives in a City and Speaks many languages (Image below displays a Business Account for a leading Jewellery business that got it wrong and mixed up with a Personal Account) It is only after they get about 100, 500 or in some cases 1000 friends that they realize that what they created was not a Business Page, but just another Personal Account.</p>
<p>For beginners, a Facebook Page can be created for a Brand, Business Product Offering or Service Offering. Here are three key differences &#8230;</p>
<ol>
<li>Unlike the Friends on your Personal Account, a Facebook Page has Likes that reflect the fan-base that the brand or business is enjoying.</li>
<li>You can create a custom Welcome Page for your Business, and add as many as custom Tabs to your Page profile while your Personal Account does not have these features.</li>
<li>Pages don’t have a timeline like your Personal Account does.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are facing a similar issue of toying with 2 or more accounts and /or Pages, here is some solution that could help you clear the clutter.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.niyati.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/fb2.jpg" alt="fb2 How to convert a Facebook Personal Account to a Business Page"  title="How to convert a Facebook Personal Account to a Business Page" /></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Converting your Facebook Personal Account to a Facebook Page</strong><br />
Facebook allows you to convert your personal account to a business account (Page) while at the same time ensuring all your contacts and friends are also moved to the new account. It is also recommended that you download all the relevant information within your account including friends list, messages posted, photos uploaded etc as a measure of backup.</p>
<p><a title="Convert a Personal Account to a Facebook Page" href="http://www.facebook.com/help/?page=213602951994043" target="_blank">Here </a>is more information on this topic. Follow <a title="Downloading your Facebook Data" href="http://www.facebook.com/help/?page=116481065103985" target="_blank">this link </a>to learn more about Downloading your Facebook Data.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Merging your duplicate Pages into one official Facebook Page</strong><br />
Having duplicate facebook pages for one brand is often a trouble. With one page scoring over with more fans and activity compared to the lesser one. It is even more difficult to do away with either of the pages, as the number of fans are considerably large. For instance, we have had duplicate pages, where one had over 80,000 Likes, while the other had 40,000 likes and both were unique set of fans. The best thing for us to happen was the possibility of merging 2 Pages into one, increasing our Fan base by over 1,20,000 in a jiffy.</p>
<p>Remember that the Page with the lesser number of likes can only be merged with the one that has more number of likes and not vice-versa. This means if you have a nice username (fb.com/businessname) for your smaller fan-base, you might have to forego that when you merge it with the one with the higher fan-base. You can read more about this topic <a title="Merging Duplicate Pages into one official Facebook Page" href="http://www.facebook.com/help/?faq=249601088403018&amp;ref_query=merge" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>But the good thing is going forward, you will not have the trouble of handling 2 different pages or accounts, and make sure all your fans are available at one common official page. This way you will cash in on effective <a title="Social Media Optimization" href="http://www.niyati.com/social-media-optimization.htm">social media optimization</a> by not only chasing one hare, but catching it too.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>QR Codes have caught the fancy of advertisers in the recent past. Starting from Ford introducing it to view the Figo video to Levis Jeans, Infosys, Platinum Guild and many more, that small little square arrangement of black and white dots are becoming a lot trendier. The recently launched GRT Jewellers Golden Seed campaign rings in the New Year with customized designer QR Code – a step ahead of the normal black and white QR codes that you have seen until recently.</p>
<p>It is the first of custom designer QR codes adopted in retail advertising and probably the first in the country. Targeted at Smartphone users with any QR Reader installed in their phones, each scan led the user to a microsite with a call-to-action. What’s important to note is that although this is targeted at a niche audience, advertisers must try and leverage best practices to make QR codes successful.</p>
<div class="p_embed p_image_embed"><img alt="goldenseed loomband.jpg.scaled500 Making best use of Designer QR Codes" src="http://getfile0.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2012-01-04/wAqbskadtlhHqxrhDjikpwJqBaiAHogHIJdqlpxwpIlxxegllgjCnlAoAeba/goldenseed-loomband.jpg.scaled500.jpg" width="500" height="575" title="Making best use of Designer QR Codes" /></div>
<p>Here are a few tips &#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1.    Enhance Brand Equity: </strong><br /> QR Codes can be more than just black and white squares and dots. You can make smart use of spaces to integrate your brand identity and win over your customers. Beautiful, rich, smart and trendy QR Codes can give your brand a facelift and also paint the picture of a savvy business. What better way to reach out to your audience in a 2cm x 2cm graphic advertisement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="p_embed p_image_embed"><img alt="Rangde.jpg.scaled500 Making best use of Designer QR Codes" src="http://getfile6.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2012-01-04/GHirkFCEDhjFdcfxxulpFBJkyIlIIujzjoanewCadJphqayyFbhnGnBcvfEn/Rangde.jpg.scaled500.jpg" width="198" height="198" title="Making best use of Designer QR Codes" /></div>
<p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><em>(Designer QR Code for Rangde.org &#8211; leads you to their website)</em></span></p>
<p><strong>2.    Ensure 360º Visibility:</strong><br /> The easiest way to let customers know about your QR code are through your regular print advertisements. But then you can also have it at any point-of-sale within your store by way of posters and outdoor media through hoardings, banners and even product packaging. If you do email marketing, online advertising and are active on social media networks, you could milk the most of these media to let the audience scan your QR code. The chances of QR scans by customers online are even more and sharing becomes easier.</p>
<p><strong>What’s in the QR Code is more important than how it looks?</strong> Most QR Codes allow you to embed an URL (which can eventually lead to a website, video, image or blog), a Text message or a Phone Number.</p>
<p>We recommend going that extra mile to make the scan worthwhile. Going by the conventional advertising adage &#8211; there are a few smart things you can do to make that QR Code attract attention, create desire and trigger an action.</p>
<p><strong>3.    Link to a Microsite :</strong><br /> Perhaps the best way to offer more information on your product and/or service is to provide a link to an URL that could be campaign specific information. Linking it to a video commercial that is already on air on popular channels might be a waste of the medium. Unless of course, if your media planner has saved you a few lakh rupees and kept your video embedded on your microsite or on YouTube. Like every good search engine marketer, we also bet on microsites that have lead generation forms to capture contact details of your customer.</p>
<div class="p_embed p_image_embed"><img alt="sunban qr designer.jpg.scaled500 Making best use of Designer QR Codes" src="http://getfile7.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2012-01-04/EkDIcFGDHADsICvEjBmuBzAemftzjyHAchjBhhojEysCtdGwGyIjEbywvqHA/sunban-qr-designer.jpg.scaled500.jpg" width="198" height="198" title="Making best use of Designer QR Codes" /></div>
<p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><em>(Designer QR Code for Saint-Gobain Sun Ban Glass)</em></span></p>
<p><strong>4.    Offer a Promo Code :</strong><br /> If you have an e-commerce site or are running a sale at your retail outlet, it is a good idea to offer a promo code that could give them either a price or a percentage discount. Customers see the promo code after scanning the QR Code and can enter it while they checkout of the shopping cart online, or while they purchase off-the-shelf. This way you ensure sales and your cash registers ringing.</p>
<p><strong>5.    Make use of SMS Short Codes :</strong><br /> You can make use of SMS Short Code services to embed key pull messages from your customers. There are also options where you can trigger an SMS to be sent to the Customer’s mobile number. The desired objective is to capture the contact information of the customers scanning the QR Code and then having your sales staff follow-up with them.</p>
<p>It doesn’t end here. Go one step further to analyse the performance of your QR Code.</p>
<p><strong>6.    Measure Scans:</strong><br /> Make use of analytics to review the number of scans on a daily basis and the region from where you are getting the most number of scans. This can be a little tricky because most analytics default it to the gateway of the telecom service provider. So a Vodafone user in Chennai might always show up as Bangalore or Mumbai. This makes it redundant, but then comparing your scans with the amount of conversions you clock daily will give you a fair idea about the performance. These metrics provide a guided mechanism to plan your advertising and marketing spends.</p>
<p><strong>7.    Improvise Campaigns:</strong><br /> Once you start seeing the results, improvise on your campaign with newer schemes and promotions. Like every business, innovation is key. Innovate on your offers and innovate on your QR codes. Touch wood, your QR codes can have customers queue up at your store – be it offline or online.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="p_embed p_image_embed"><img alt="Acme2.jpg.scaled500 Making best use of Designer QR Codes" src="http://getfile3.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2012-01-04/mfFuEhsbpcwhnbhGIqHJwEAhiGdoeGkfwzwCtofubbBtJxqAfclvBDhtvhFv/Acme2.jpg.scaled500.jpg" width="295" height="295" title="Making best use of Designer QR Codes" /></div>
<p><em><span style="font-size: x-small;">(Designer QR Code for Acme Fitness &#8211; leading to the TRUE Fitness Campaign)</span></em></p>
<p>Albeit new to a desired Indian Target audience, the marketer must remember that the smartphone users are much lesser compared to the mobile phone users. And then the number of smartphone users who have a built-in QR scanner (in their smartphone or tablet) and those who know how to use them are relatively lesser. But the interesting and the promising fact is that, this is set to grow in the coming years. And with mobile commerce picking up, what better way to make a sale than by just scanning the QR Code.</p>
<p>The GRT Golden Seed Campaign with its Lotus QR Code was developed by <a title="Designer QR Codes from Niyati" href="http://www.niyati.com" target="_blank">Niyati</a> and integrates Analytics to not only measure the number of scans of the QR Code but also the conversions that happened at the microsite. This may be India’s first attempt at designer QR Codes by a Retail Jeweller and we are happy to be connected with a niche smartphone audience and grab their attention.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Upgrades can sometimes really turn you down. Especially when you are ignorant of them. In a similar instance we faced yesterday, I thought it best to blog about this for the benefit of others who are looking to do similar activity on their emailer communications. A month ago, around May 18th Twitter upgraded to a new UI and together with it some of the code that worked earlier (we had sent an emailer out on May 17th and it worked perfect) didn&#8217;t really support the new UI. Twitter did give the option for users to switch back to the old UI, but not before doing a global transition. We had problems with a simple Tweet This button that we had added to our emailer.</p>
<p><em>The <strong>older code</strong> worked with a simple line of code</em> :- <span style="font-size: small"><a href="http://twitter.com/home?status=Your+Message+Goes+Here">http://twitter.com/home?status=Your+Message+Goes+Here</a></span></p>
<p>As a matter of fact, if you prefixed www. to the domain making it <a href="http://www.twitter.com/home?status=">http://www.twitter.com/home?status=</a> , the code does not work. Pretty strange. But twitter prefers and demands to keep it that way.</p>
<p><em>The <strong>newer code </strong>works this way : &#8211; </em><a href="http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=">http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=</a><span style="font-size: small">Your+Message+Goes+Here</span></p>
<p>Where &#8216; home?status= &#8216; is replaced with &#8216; tweet?text= &#8216;. Please note that there is a new parameter here called &#8216;intent&#8217; after twitter.com, which I presume is to make sure of your intention to tweet the message <img src="http://www.niyati.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon smile Adding a Tweet This in your emailers   updated to match the new Twitter UI" class="wp-smiley" title="Adding a Tweet This in your emailers   updated to match the new Twitter UI" /> </p>
<p>Please note that this is not ReTweet, which will require additional support files, but this is simply tweeting a preset message without the RT and other frills. </p>
