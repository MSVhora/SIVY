<p>When does recycling become an act of love? When you give away stuff you own to someone who can really use it. </p>
<p>As part of Shaastra, the reputed annual tech fest at IIT Madras, Niyati helped build the <a title="Pledge A Book Website" href="http://www.pledgeabook-shaastra.org" target="_blank">website for Pledge-a-book</a> campaign, a social initiative from the students at IIT Madras, that helped collect books from patrons to be given to those with limited access to learning resources. </p>
<p>Niyati is proud to be associated with the campaign that propagates the power of learning. After all, promoting continuous learning is what we at Niyati hold close to our hearts.</p>
<p>When a group of young enterprising students from the great institution approached us with their plan to take their year old campaign to the digital medium, we opted in and offered our services pro bono!</p>

<p>Across South East Asia, one in 12 adults is a diabetic. One in two people with Diabetes do not know they have it. In the year 2014, a total of 4.9 million deaths worldwide have been attributed to the disease. According to the  International Diabetic Federation, India ranks first in the top 5 South East Asian countries for the number of people with diabetes in the adult age group. Recent studies by the Madras Diabetic Research Foundation have indicated that the prevalence of diabetes has increased in the metros of Chennai and Delhi.</p>
<p>Talk about timely interventions. Thanks to the aspiration of two enterprising NRI couples from Canada, you can now access holistic diabetes prevention, education and self management care through Diasem in Chennai.</p>
<p>Niyati was commissioned to design and develop a <a title="medical website" href="http://www.niyati.com/medical-website-design.htm">medical website</a> tailored to the specifications of our client using WordPress as the CMS. The website has been developed in a responsive framework for optimal viewing experience on your mobile devices.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you write content for the web, you want to be informative, consultative or authoritative on the subject that you write about. Irrespective of how you want to approach your writing, you have to have an <b>objective </b>in mind to influence your reader. It is worth pausing here to note that readers have objectives too; in particular, <b>the desire to gain something of value in return for their investment of time spent (in reading).</b> </p>
<p>What is the objective of the content? What is the goal intended to be attained?  What is the purpose, the benefit or the reason you wrote a piece of content?</p>
<p>For some, it could be to give easy access to information on the product or service you offer to your customers and for some others it could be about convincing your reader about something that you believe in. Every piece of content you write has to have an objective. </p>
<p>Here are a couple of strategies that great content writers use to write content that sticks and works!</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: large">ESP</span></strong></p>
<p>ESP also means <a title="ESP" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrasensory_perception" target="_blank">Extra Sensory Perception,</a> but in the context of content strategy it means- Engage, Stimulate and Persuade.</p>
<p>When you write content, it is recommended that you <b>write for an audience of one. </b>Even though you know that the content is going to be read by a global audience of varying age groups, cultures and dispositions, it is important to address each reader as an individual and not as a member of a specific community.</p>
<p>In the book, &#8216;<i><a title="Can I Change Your Mind" href="http://books.google.co.in/books?id=s5nAGp-_xQ4C&amp;pg=PT30&amp;lpg=PT30&amp;dq=Reading+is+a+solitary+activity.+It+happens+in+your+head&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nQ8XeZNnpi&amp;sig=B07vjfqzyvGGoGIBebbchEmL8Fs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1K7_UIzlIIvMrQevvIGAAw&amp;redir_esc=y" target="_blank">Can I change your mind</a> &#8216;</i> the author Lindsay Camp, succinctly elaborates and I quote:</p>
<p><i>“Reading is a solitary activity. It happens in your head and when you read something I have written, you are in effect, allowing me to join you in there. I&#8217;m a guest and as such, though I may know next to nothing about you, it is up to me to strike a relationship with you, to find a way of making whatever I have to say engaging, stimulating and persuasive to you.”</i></p>
<p>That being said, even though you may not know every person that reads your content, you do know that it addresses a <b>target audience. </b>For example, the people who will evaluate and compare your product or service against others in the market before  hiring you or making a buying decision. When you write content that engages, stimulates and persuades <i>that </i>group of people, you have a winner!</p>
<p>The aim, put simply, is to write for a reader you have never met which should be similar to writing for one you know well.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large"><strong>Tune in</strong></span></p>
<p>Much has been said about being emotive when you converse with your clients on phone. Empathy, your ability to reflect the emotions of the person you communicate with, is crucial to any conversation and I don’t mean <i>spoken</i> alone.</p>
<p><b>Is it possible to<i> write </i>with empathy too? </b>Understand how the reader of content you write, is likely to feel?  Good persuasive writers do this instinctively, says Lindsay Camp:</p>
<p><i> “They find out what they can about the reader, make reasonable assumptions and intelligent deductions about</i><i> <b>Why, When and Where</b> the reader will read. They think logically about how she (the reader) is likely to feel towards what they have to say. Then they make an imaginative leap that enables them to tune in to the emotion or set of emotions that will have a bearing on the success or failure of a particular piece of communication.”</i></p>
<p><b>Can I learn how to tune in?</b></p>
<p>Good communicators<i> </i>don&#8217;t make a conscious effort to tune in. It comes naturally to them. For the rest of us, the good news is, empathy can be learned! So long as you are<b> involved and intuitive</b> and <b><i>not</i> objective and detached,</b> you can easily &#8216;tune in&#8217; to the emotional state of your reader. The process requires not just logical and analytical thinking but also a degree of intuition and empathy.</p>
<p>I know many of you are on your way to becoming superlative writers already. Share what your objectives are when you write content. The next time you write content on your blog use these strategies and tell us how it has changed the way you write. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-930" alt="writing for web 3 Qualities to Nurture While Writing for the Web" src="http://www.niyati.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/writing-for-web.jpg" width="664" height="286" title="3 Qualities to Nurture While Writing for the Web" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As much as I know, understand and agree that having a great product or service to sell maybe the key factor for a successful business, I also value, treasure and appreciate the fact that knowing<b> how to talk or write </b>about your great product or service is almost as critical as the product or service itself.</p>
<p>Let us look at some of the components that become critical when <a title="Content development" href="http://www.niyati.com/content-development.htm">writing content</a> for your company website:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large"><strong>Passion:</strong></span></p>
<p>As a reader, I get bored with content that is dull and uninspiring. I never blog or write a forum post when I am not inspired to write. When you are <b>passionate</b> about the product or service that you sell, it will show in the way you write. When you write with passion, the quality of your writing will instantly be better and you will write interesting content. Many of us are plagued by doubt if our writing will be read at all. When you are the expert who knows how your product or service works, who better than you to write about it? When that thought is on your mind, you will write like an expert and people will look forward to more of what you have to say.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large"><strong>Quality:</strong></span></p>
<p>It is true that you will turn out expert quality content when you write with passion. However, it is not a given that you will write without errors in sentence structure, grammar and spelling. So it is crucial to perform a <b>quality check</b> of the content written for errors in English, in terms of spell checks and grammar checks. You can always run it through an English expert or a spell check software program that will polish the grammar and spell check. Remember, if <i>you</i> are not happy with the quality, neither will your readers be! </p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large"><strong>Value:</strong></span></p>
<p>Acknowledging that the readers of your posts will look for value additions to the knowledge they already have, will help you write better content. So you have to write keeping in mind the needs of a variety of readers. Perhaps they belong to a group of people who do not know how the product works and are finding ways to learn or they may belong to a group who already use the product or know how to and are looking for valuable additional information. Including links to further reading, for people who understand the basics is one way of adding value to your content. Inviting people to share their knowledge and experience related to your product or service is another way of adding value to your content.</p>
<p>I believe that when you write with passion, check for quality and provide <strong>valuable knowledge</strong>, you can produce content that is fresh, relevant and ever green. Your readers will be happy and look forward to your writing. </p>
<p>In your writing experience what has been the single most challenging hurdle you had to overcome to write quality content?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-870" alt="CS 1b Tongue tied on telephone?" src="http://www.niyati.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/CS-1b.jpg" width="664" height="286" title="Tongue tied on telephone?" /></p>
<p>Many of us are great conversationalists. Some of us are better with face to face conversations than telephonic and some of us are happier when we don&#8217;t see the face of the person whom we talk to. Telephonic conversations become even more stressful when we are expected to speak in English – <i>especially</i> if you have to speak to native speakers of English.</p>
<p>If you work at the customer end of a corporate company that deals with global customers, the chances are you are expected to use flawless English to communicate details of the service or product you sell. The expectation can be nerve wrecking for someone who is not confident with the use of the language. You cannot expect to speak flawlessly on the phone when you do not speak in English <i>at all</i> <i>other</i> times. Add to it the different accents, unfamiliar words and phrases; telephonic conversations can become even more daunting than it otherwise is. Other than making errors in English, we also rush through what we say, don’t pause to confirm understanding, forget to actively listen and pause at the wrong places!</p>
<p> What is important to appreciate and understand is the fact that native speakers of English <b>do not</b> expect us to be perfect. They do realize that English is not our first language <i>and</i> they make an effort to understand us.  English errors apart, there are other areas in telephonic conversations that can improve with practice. These will help you have smooth, clear conversations on telephone.</p>
<p>Here are a few key pointers, in the context of a non native speaker of English that will tell you how to <b>avoid having disastrous conversations </b>on telephone.</p>
<p> <b>Think before you dial:</b> This is the first step before you actually make that call. Write down points that you intend to convey or clarify on the telephone.<b> </b>Write key words or phrases that will trigger the point you want to speak about. When the telephone is answered, state the purpose of the call clearly and also indicate how long the call will take.</p>
<p><b>Use balance in conversation -</b> Do not talk without pausing for the other to respond or interrupt. When you get involved in a monologue, you may feel happy and satisfied at the end of the conversation, but you have no way to judge if the receiver of the information understood entirely what you said.</p>
<p> <b>Listen:</b>  I don&#8217;t think there is anything more to be said here. When you have initiated the call, it does not mean you have to control who speaks. You <b>have to listen </b>to what the person on the other end has to say. Listening, as you all know, is incomplete when you do not do it actively. What I mean by<b> active listening</b> is making short notes, grabbing words, phrases that he uses to tell you what he thinks or what he wants done, so that when you end the conversation, you can effectively summarize / paraphrase what you heard.</p>
<p> <b>Watch that tone:</b> Your work may demand that you speak to people from different parts of the World. What may seem as an acceptable tone to converse in with someone from your country may not sound appropriate to someone from another culture. Especially over the telephone when you have no way of communicating with body language or expressions and your message entirely depends on the tone you choose to speak.</p>
<p> A simple NO can sound abrupt and rude when it is not said in the right tone or is not justified with a reason. Setting the mood of the conversation using the right tone is crucial.</p>
<p> <b>Avoid dead air</b>: Often times, during telephone conversations, when we don&#8217;t have an appropriate answer or we don&#8217;t know what to say (because you need to check some detail more than being at a loss of words), we tend to go quiet. This can be very annoying to the other person who will wonder if you are still there. He will have to know that we are still an active participant in the conversation and that we need some time to respond. A good practice is to use the hold procedure and/or give him a time frame by which you will get back.</p>
<p> I am sure these thoughts have triggered many other points that you have noticed about telephonic conversations at work. Why don&#8217;t you share it with us?</p>
<p>There is always a scope to learn and improve, don&#8217;t you agree?</p>

<p>I was watching an inspiring <a title="Video" href="http://chill.com/hiten/post/2075a3f794ab4aee8a40bffa8e0326c5/jason-fried-37-signals-marketing-by-sharing" target="_blank">video</a> from <a title="Jason Fried" href="https://twitter.com/#!/jasonfried" target="_blank">Jason Fried</a> and I am encouraged to share knowledge I think is important for anyone to know.</p>
<p>My core area of work involves a lot of follow ups with prospective clients who have enquired about our services on email. Typically if the client has shared enough details on the project, I respond to the enquiry with a proposal. However, sometimes we have clients who are unsure of how to go about hiring a <a title="Web Design Company" href="http://www.niyati.com/" target="_blank">web design company</a> to do what they have in mind. These are the times when my other skills are put to use. Probing is one of them. I ask a series of open ended questions to find out what the client has in mind. Some questions are framed in such a way to trigger other thoughts that the client has not thought through. This way, he is encouraged to share what the vision of the company is or what the mission statement of the company is, both of which are crucial information when we design logos and websites.</p>
<p>Sending a proposal once the probing is done is only half the battle won. Even more important is follow-up.  Most often, we have clients who write to half a dozen companies for competitive quotes. For want of business, companies quote a range of prices and the client is left confused with his options. What can set you apart in such situations is how well you follow up.</p>
<p>As much as it is important to send a quotation for the enquiry immediately, it is crucial that your client knows that he is dealing with professionals who really care about his project whatever the size of the business. When you follow up after you have sent the proposal, it is not enough to ask the client if decisions have been taken and if you have been short listed as likely vendor for the business. With the information you have from the probing and understanding of the client’s needs, you have enough pointers to send him interesting information that could add value to his business. For example, we often send links to our past works with companies in the related industry to give them ideas for their own website.</p>
<p>When the client senses that you are genuinely interested in working with him, he will give you business. Sometimes the client may have a valid reason why he may not be able to work with you immediately. But that follow up from you will help create a positive moment of truth in your prospects mind and he will remember you and the services offered by your company, should there arise another opportunity to work with you.</p>
<p>What other ways do you employ to make your prospective customer interested in your service?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you are good at what you do, your inbox fills up with enquiries for services you offer from prospective clients, appreciative mails from clients you have worked with and also the unpleasant attention from spammers.</p>
<p>Our pet peeve in the recent times have been spammers. We seldom pass an opportunity to let the spammers know that what they do is not appreciated. However, when one stops, five others begin!</p>
<p>We probably could be more tolerant to such spam mails, if only they were written well. At Niyati, we always see the bright side of things. Learn from every experience, is our unwritten motto.</p>
<p>The event that triggered this posterous blog is one such spam email that was delivered to our inbox this morning from a company called Pheunix.com</p>
<p>Three things happened when I opened the mail this morning:</p>
<p>1) The email triggered this blog post</p>
<p>2) I had my share of laughs for the week.</p>
<p>3) My flu got worse</p>
<p>Jokes apart, if only companies like these could keep a check on the language on the website, by some freak chance, they may even land a project for real. Read and judge for yourselves if we are over reacting to such emails:</p>
