				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1320" alt="hotel online marketing Marketing Your Hotel Online – A Checklist" src="http://www.niyati.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/hotel-online-marketing.jpg" width="666" height="270" title="Marketing Your Hotel Online – A Checklist" /></p>
<p>The internet has opened up a whole new world of marketing opportunities for hotels and businesses in the travel and tourism industry. Traditional ways of marketing hotels are no more effective when your aim is to attract visitors from across the world.</p>
<p>Smart hotel marketers have already chosen internet as their preferred marketing medium. The scalability, cost-effectiveness and faster execution of ideas make the internet just perfect for marketing hotels.</p>
<p>If your hotel business hasn&#8217;t taken the online leap yet, this is the time to do so. Let us explain how you can leverage the internet medium in the best possible manner:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Improved website design: </b></span></p>
<p>Your hotel’s website often creates the first impression of your property to a potential visitor. So it is important that you pull out all stops to ensure that the visitor develops a favorable attitude towards your hotel. This means that your website must have meaningful content, should load fast, have excellent navigation, updated video and photo galleries and even interactive features like virtual tour and location map. Make sure your website layout is uncluttered, elegant and content rich.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Go mobile:</b></span></p>
<p>Mobile device adoption is clearly on the rise and it is vital that your website is also responsive to mobile and tablet devices. Your mobile website needs to be straightforward, so that the most important information is displayed right at the top and unnecessary clutter is avoided. <a title="Responsive Web Design" href="http://www.niyati.com/responsive-web-design.htm">Responsive Web Design</a> technology may be used to ensure that an optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices like desktops, smartphones and tablets. What’s more, even <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.ch/2012/06/recommendations-for-building-smartphone.html" target="_blank">Google recommends</a> responsive websites.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Ride the social media wave:</b></span></p>
<p>The social media movement is here to stay and your hotel can reap all its benefit by establishing a powerful presence on social media channels like Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Google + and YouTube. For example, you can share pictures of your hotel on your hotel’s Pinterest channel which will get repinned by your followers and thus introduce your hotel to more potential visitors. Reputation management is an important factor to be kept in mind while engaging via social media channels.  By creating an active social media campaign on Facebook and Twitter, you can keep people aware of happenings in your hotel and in your region.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Adopt paid advertising:</b></span></p>
<p>If you have the marketing budget or need quick results, don’t forget to include well conceived and positioned paid ads in your online media campaign. Digital advertising services like Google Ads and Facebook Ads offer a variety of advantages like precise targeting and estimation capabilities that traditional ads do not offer. For example, with Google Ads, you can ensure that your ads are displayed at those places where they are likely to be seen by the very people they are targeted at. For example, if your hotel has a golf course, Google can display your ads in websites, blogs and forums that discuss golf, thereby bringing your hotel in front of a targeted crowd.</p>
<p>Digital advertising also offers the facility of re-targeting, i.e., advertising to a consumer who has shown some sort of engagement with the brand, especially when the previous case did not result in a conversion. This way, it becomes possible to leverage on the earlier marketing that took the consumer to the previous brand’s site in the first place and thus, increase chances of a future conversion taking place.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Present yourself on popular travel portals:</b></span></p>
<p>Make sure that your hotel is listed on popular travel portals like TripAdvisor, Expedia, Booking.com, etc. Not only does this help improve your visibility to visitors from across the world, it also helps you tap into the traffic generated by these portals, especially if your hotel is one of the major accommodation facilities in your area.</p>
<p>Make sure your hotel is also listed in <a href="https://www.google.com/hotels" target="_blank">Google Hotels</a>, which is currently being majorly promoted by Google.</p>
<p>If your hotel is known for its restaurants, make sure they are listed on leading restaurant review sites like Yelp.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Reviews:</b></span></p>
<p>For every hotel, getting positive reviews on travel portals and social channels is extremely important. Make sure you take every effort in getting positive, descriptive feedback from your customers. You can vastly improve your review count with simple steps like sending a thank you note to the customer with direct links to the review pages and specifically requesting them to post their experience.</p>
<p>Make sure to check back regularly on your review pages and respond to any negative comments quickly and compassionately.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Local optimization:</b> </span></p>
<p>When Google detects that your search query carries local intent, it provides a list of business listings relating to your query that are located near you. For example, if you search for “hotels in New York”, Google will give you business listings of popular hotels in New York along with their NPA (name, phone number and address).  It is important that you optimize local search to the fullest extent as it gives you a significant advantage over other bigger hotels. Let’s put it like this- the bigger hotels may have a bigger website and the best SEO tactics in place, but your location will give you the edge that you need to make sure that the user zeroes in on your hotel.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Video optimization:</b></span></p>
<p>In order to improve your site’s visibility online, you can upload videos of your hotel and its offerings to your site which not only give your potential visitors a better idea of the overall décor of your hotel and the services offered, but also help bring more visitors to your site by the use of appropriate SEO tactics. For example, you can upload a few videos to YouTube and attach a few links to your hotel’s website. This way, if the user likes what he sees in the video, he can conveniently click on the link and be taken to your website. <b></b></p>
<p>In addition, if your hotel is based in a city that is a popular tourist spot, you can take videos of the tourist attractions in your city and upload them to your hotel website, thus promoting your hotel indirectly.</p>
<p>If your website includes streaming videos, don’t forget to employ effective video optimization tactics, including having a video sitemap.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><b>E-commerce integration: </b></span></p>
<p>Make sure to make the online booking facility in your hotel website simple, seamless and secure. <a title="Online Booking" href="http://www.niyati.com/e-commerce-services.htm">Online booking</a> is a very convenient way for visitors to book their stay with minimum effort on their part. A large chunk of hotel bookings nowadays is made online and you need to ensure that you don’t lose out on this promising opportunity to increase hotel occupancy.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Marketing through external blogs:</b></span></p>
<p>External blog marketing can be of many types: either you place ads on blogs relevant to your subject, or you could write guest posts on other influential travel blogs. From a hotel’s point of view, it makes sense to place ads for your hotel on popular hotel blogs. As a respected hotelier, you can even offer to write a guest post on a popular hotel blog in which you may give your views about the hospitality industry. While writing your guest post, don’t forget to include a link to your hotel website!<b> </b>You can also reach out to popular bloggers to mention or review your hotel on their blogs. An approval by a respected and popular blogger can translate into a significantly higher number of visitors.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Email marketing:</b></span></p>
<p>Creating a robust email database of your customers is an excellent way to stay in touch with them and let them know about new offers at your hotel. Another excellent tactic would be to send them creatively designed e-cards on special occasions like birthday, anniversary or during religious festivals.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Conclusion: </b></span></p>
<p>The above are some of the tactics that will go a great way in enhancing your hotel&#8217;s online presence. What is important is to use the internet medium effectively by keeping your audience consistently engaged in a creative, honest way. This will not just improve your hotel&#8217;s reputation online, but encourage visitors to recommend your hotel to their peers.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1273" title="Tips to Get Website Indexed" alt="Tips Website Not Getting Indexed? Here’s What You Need to Check" src="http://www.niyati.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Tips.jpg" width="664" height="286" /></p>
<p>The whole point of having a website is to make it visible across the web and appeal to target visitors. If your website is not indexed, it won’t appear in the search results and this defeats the purpose for which it was created in the first place. There might be a lot of reasons behind search engines not indexing your website. Here is the checklist of common problems related to site indexing and the solutions to fix them.<br /> </p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: large">Robots.txt</span></strong></p>
<p>Robots.txt, if present, is the first thing that a search engine bot looks up when visiting your website. It is used by webmasters to provide instructions to the search engine bots visiting a site. If your robots.txt file carried instructions to discourage search engine crawling, your site may not get indexed. You can check your site’s robots file by adding <em>/robots.txt</em> at the end of your domain name.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class=" wp-image-1281 aligncenter" title="Robots File Tag" alt="robots tag Website Not Getting Indexed? Here’s What You Need to Check" src="http://www.niyati.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/robots-tag.jpg" width="96" height="44" /></p>
<p>If you see the above instruction in your robots.txt file, it means that the search engine bots are discouraged from crawling your site’s content. You can fix this issue easily by removing the ‘/’ from this command. You can use the robots.txt file effectively to de-index specific folders in your site. <a title="Google's Robots.txt File" href="http://www.google.com/robots.txt" target="_blank">Google’s very own robots file</a> has covered an extensive list of commands. Check it out for your reference.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large"><b>Meta Tags</b></span></p>
<p><b></b>It is a common practice by webmasters to use meta ‘robots’ tag to prevent search engine bots from crawling a particular web page. If a particular page in your website doesn’t get indexed, check its source code for this meta tag:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class=" wp-image-1278 aligncenter" title="meta no follow tag" alt="meta no follow tag Website Not Getting Indexed? Here’s What You Need to Check" src="http://www.niyati.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/meta-no-follow-tag.jpg" width="333" height="27" /></p>
<p>This tag will prevent the web page from being crawled by the search engine bots. Some WordPress themes incorporate this meta tag by default. If your WP site has indexing problems, it is worth checking the theme header for this tag. Once this tag is removed from the source code, search engine bots can crawl the particular web page.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large"><b>Sitemap Errors</b></span></p>
<p>A sitemap (XML or HTML) provides a search engine robot with the list of URLs to be crawled in your website. If for some reasons the sitemap in your website is not automatically updated, search engine bots may some time to discover those webpages and this would cause delay in indexing.</p>
<p>You need to check out the Webmaster tool (set up a Google Webmaster account for your site if you don’t already have it) for issues related to the sitemap. The Sitemap Details page will inform you about the errors in it. Once the errors are fixed, you can <a title="Sitemap Generator" href="http://www.xml-sitemaps.com/" target="_blank">generate a new xml sitemap</a> for your site and upload it in the root for your website.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large"><b>Other Crawling Errors</b></span></p>
<p>Once you’ve ruled out the above mentioned problems, head to your Google Webmaster Tools dashboard and check for crawling errors. The crawling errors need to be fixed as and when you see them. Some of the page crawling errors might be related <a title="URL Parameter" href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/1235687?hl=en" target="_blank">URL parameter</a> issues, which mostly happen in the case of dynamic links. You can fix errors like this by using a simple 301 redirect.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large"><b>Getting Indexed Under a Different Domain Name</b></span></p>
<p>Before coming to a conclusion that your website is not indexed, check out for other variations in your domain name that might have been indexed by search engines. For instance, http://www.yoursite.com and http://yoursite.com might look similar to you. However, they are two different URLs according to the search engines.</p>
<p>If you website is indexed in a different name than the one you preferred, you need to specify your preferred domain name in the Webmaster tools and use a <a title="301 Redirect" href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/93633" target="_blank">301 redirect</a>. You can also use <a title="Canonical Link Element" href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/139394?hl=en" target="_blank">canonical link element</a> for setting the most preferred URL version but a 301 redirect is more effective.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large"><b>No Incoming Links</b></span></p>
<p>This issue is common in websites that are new to the web. If your website doesn’t have any incoming links from other websites, it might take a while for Google to find your site. If you wish to get your site indexed soon, you may have to build some backlinks manually. Backlinks from high PR websites will provide more link weightage to your website thereby helping it get indexed soon.</p>
<p>Submitting your site to Google Plus will earn you an incoming link and help your site get discovered by the search engine bots. You can also <a title="Submit to Google" href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/submit-url" target="_blank">submit your site URL to Google</a> through your Webmasters tool. These methods will significantly improve the chances of getting indexed by Google.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large"><b>AJAX Applications</b></span></p>
<p>If your website runs AJAX application, it would contain AJAX URLs (a URL with # fragment) and the content of these URLs can’t be crawled by search engine bots. This, in turn, would prevent the search engines from indexing your website. There is a <a title="AJAX URL Crawling" href="https://developers.google.com/webmasters/ajax-crawling/" target="_blank">separate process</a> to help search engine bots crawl AJAX content. The solution provided by Google Developers will help you fix this issue.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large"><b>Bad Links &amp; Google Reconsideration Request</b></span></p>
<p>It is important for a site owner to constantly assess the quality of incoming links. The inbound links to your website should not violate <a title="Google's Guidelines" href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/35769#3" target="_blank">Google’s guidelines</a> on link quality. You can detect these bad links through your Google Webmaster Tools. If your site has too many bad links, it will be de-indexed by Google and other search engines.</p>
<p>If by any chance your website has been de-indexed due to this issue, you need to <a title="Disavow Bad Links" href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/2648487?hl=en" target="_blank">disavow</a> these bad links completely and make sure that your site no longer violates the guidelines. Once this is fixed, you need to submit a reconsideration request to Google through your Webmaster tools.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large"><b>SEO Spamming</b></span></p>
<p>There are many black hat SEO techniques practiced by spammers to get higher rankings instantly. Google constantly keeps tab of its search results quality and takes <a title="Google's Manual Action" href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/2604824" target="_blank">manual action</a> on sites that employ spamming techniques. Shortcut methods like cloaking, keyword stuffing, content scraping and spam links etc. will get your site permanently de-indexed.</p>
<p>The simple solution here is to clean up your site of all the spamming techniques and submit a <a title="Reconsideration Request" href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/35843?hl=en" target="_blank">reconsideration request</a> through your Webmaster tools.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large"><b>Malware Ridden Websites</b></span></p>
<p>Websites infected with malwares may get disappeared from search results very soon. The silver lining here is that you can find the issue before your site gets de-indexed. Google Webmaster Tools will issue a warning that your site has been compromised. Once you’ve discovered the issue, you can remove the malware and enhance your site’s security. You can also submit a reconsideration request if your site has already been de-indexed.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large"><b>Website Downtime</b></span></p>
<p>If your website is continuously down for a significant period (say a few weeks) of time, it might get de-indexed from the search engines. The only solution here is to fix the issue causing downtime and get your site back online. Once your site is back online, it may take a while to get your traffic back to its normal status. If your site isn’t indexed even after fixing the issue, you may have to submit the reconsideration request in the Webmaster Tools.</p>
<p>In addition to the ones listed here, Google has also mentioned a <a title="URLs Not Indexed" href="http://support.google.com/customsearch/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=115963" target="_blank">few more cases</a> in which your site may not get indexed.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large"><strong>Fetch as Google</strong></span></p>
<p>If you believe your website doesn&#8217;t have any of the above issues, here&#8217;s a simple way to get your web page indexed: Log on to your Google Webmaster Tools account and click on &#8216;Fetch as Google&#8217; link under &#8216;Crawl&#8217;. Enter your URL and submit to index. You may see the page indexed on Google within seconds. I do this every time I publish a new blog post and it works like a charm.  </p>
<p>Conclusion:</p>
<p>These are some of the common issues you need to check if your site hasn&#8217;t got indexed.  If you have experienced website indexing issues other than the ones listed here,  feel free to mention it in the comments below.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="size-full wp-image-886 alignnone" alt="responsive What 2013 has in store for Online Businesses in India?" src="http://www.niyati.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/responsive.jpg" width="664" height="286" title="What 2013 has in store for Online Businesses in India?" /></p>
<p>Our young generation lives and breathes digital. It’s like that old joke saying, “I was not born. I was downloaded.” So with much happening in the digital space in the country, it is but important for businesses and their websites to live up to (or rather surpass) the expectations of the average user (the viewer). Everybody has got talking on SoLoMo (Social, Local and Mobile), but then are businesses prepared to delve deeper? Do they have the resources in place to handle the new media demands? We take a look at a few important trends to watch out for that will perhaps shape up the digital cloud nine in the country.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Responsive is the way to go.</strong> Do you want your website to be device agnostic? Check out our <a href="/responsive-web-design.htm">responsive web design services</a>. Website designers will soon have to catch-up and adapt to<a title="responsive web design" href="/responsive-web-design.htm"> responsive design</a> practices to offer businesses the best of all worlds when it comes to <a title="Website Application Development" href="/web-application-development.htm">website development</a> – be it for viewing on a PC, a Tablet, a Mobile Device or a large screen LED TV. Usability engineers and designers will find navigation a challenge but more innovative approaches are likely to be witnessed in the coming months ahead. With Responsive Navigation, we expect new breakthroughs to happen in mobile advertising and content for search.</li>
<li><strong>App it up.</strong> Sizeable players like Flipkart, Jabong, Quikr, Redbus, Cleartrip and several others made headway in online shopping in 2012. And a number of them have witnessed a chunk of the traffic from mobile users – both via Apps as well as mobile browsers. Thanks to the burgeoning community of mobile internet users, businesses and brands will look to leverage more from the mobile media – via apps, mobile advertising and mobile-friendly websites. Time is also ripe for M-Commerce with mobile apps. While the payment gateway providers in India are still only a hand few (direct players include ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Citibank and Axis Bank, and third-party providers include CCAvenue, TechPro, EBS, Payu), we are expecting PayPal to come back with India-centric products that will be a boon to small businesses.</li>
<li><strong>Video Marketing.</strong> A powerful tool for content marketers and <a title="SEO Services India" href="/search-engine-optimization.htm">SEO</a> analysts working with Online PR, video clips and video advertising is set to be in demand. Brands as well as businesses will make use of short-video clips to popularise or even test-market their product and service offering. One can lean back to the free media on YouTube, Vimeo, and Facebook instead of spending on paid channels. What’s more interesting is the rise HTML5 players that now make video-viewing compatible across iOS devices (earlier Flash based video players were not compatible on an iPhone and iPad).</li>
<li><strong>Hack the Hacker.</strong> While security will continue to be a threat from across all corners, one should expect more hackers to be on the pry. It may not only be defacing a website or robbing data from the database, but something as simple as content hacking also stands a threat to a brand’s visibility and presence online. Designers and developers will look for building solutions to overcome loopholes with decreased dependencies on insecure plug-ins. Thanks to analytics, statcounters and webmaster tools, one can monitor traffic to the website, see deviating trends in traffic and search strings and attend to immediate resolutions in the instance of a script or code injection.</li>
<li><strong>Store them on the cloud.</strong> Hosting service providers are in for a fortune. With the amount of data, not to mention the tens and thousands of kilobyte videos and images out there, cloud storage will gain popularity. Equally integral will be the cloud backup software and cloud backup devices that will help digitization in a big way. What may not change much is the pricing of the Indian Data Centre which still continues to be on the steeply higher side when compared to the global cloud hosting players outside. So we will continue to depend on our foreign friends. Although Hostgator and GoDaddy have started India operations, their data centres are still outside India.</li>
</ol>
<p>To sum up, businesses and their marketing task force have a bigger challenge in hand as their target audience is now more than equipped with the power of choice at their finger-tips. It just takes a click and a swipe to decide on what to buy. So it is important to address your brand’s visibility on the mobile media as much as it should on the digital cloud.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.niyati.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/fb-Header.jpg" alt="fb Header How to convert a Facebook Personal Account to a Business Page"  title="How to convert a Facebook Personal Account to a Business Page" /></p>
<p>There is an old saying about chasing two hares and catching none. And we know many out there who have done this. Blame it on the sheer enthusiasm to self-learning or the I-know-it-all approach. They end up messing their social media presence. Often in a hurry to create a Facebook presence for their Brand, they end up with a Personal account calling it their official Facebook page. And therefore, the first name and last name becomes the name of the company that has a fictitious date of birth belonging to either the male or female sex. In some cases this Brand also went to a School, Lives in a City and Speaks many languages (Image below displays a Business Account for a leading Jewellery business that got it wrong and mixed up with a Personal Account) It is only after they get about 100, 500 or in some cases 1000 friends that they realize that what they created was not a Business Page, but just another Personal Account.</p>
<p>For beginners, a Facebook Page can be created for a Brand, Business Product Offering or Service Offering. Here are three key differences &#8230;</p>
<ol>
<li>Unlike the Friends on your Personal Account, a Facebook Page has Likes that reflect the fan-base that the brand or business is enjoying.</li>
<li>You can create a custom Welcome Page for your Business, and add as many as custom Tabs to your Page profile while your Personal Account does not have these features.</li>
<li>Pages don’t have a timeline like your Personal Account does.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are facing a similar issue of toying with 2 or more accounts and /or Pages, here is some solution that could help you clear the clutter.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.niyati.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/fb2.jpg" alt="fb2 How to convert a Facebook Personal Account to a Business Page"  title="How to convert a Facebook Personal Account to a Business Page" /></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Converting your Facebook Personal Account to a Facebook Page</strong><br />
Facebook allows you to convert your personal account to a business account (Page) while at the same time ensuring all your contacts and friends are also moved to the new account. It is also recommended that you download all the relevant information within your account including friends list, messages posted, photos uploaded etc as a measure of backup.</p>
<p><a title="Convert a Personal Account to a Facebook Page" href="http://www.facebook.com/help/?page=213602951994043" target="_blank">Here </a>is more information on this topic. Follow <a title="Downloading your Facebook Data" href="http://www.facebook.com/help/?page=116481065103985" target="_blank">this link </a>to learn more about Downloading your Facebook Data.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Merging your duplicate Pages into one official Facebook Page</strong><br />
Having duplicate facebook pages for one brand is often a trouble. With one page scoring over with more fans and activity compared to the lesser one. It is even more difficult to do away with either of the pages, as the number of fans are considerably large. For instance, we have had duplicate pages, where one had over 80,000 Likes, while the other had 40,000 likes and both were unique set of fans. The best thing for us to happen was the possibility of merging 2 Pages into one, increasing our Fan base by over 1,20,000 in a jiffy.</p>
<p>Remember that the Page with the lesser number of likes can only be merged with the one that has more number of likes and not vice-versa. This means if you have a nice username (fb.com/businessname) for your smaller fan-base, you might have to forego that when you merge it with the one with the higher fan-base. You can read more about this topic <a title="Merging Duplicate Pages into one official Facebook Page" href="http://www.facebook.com/help/?faq=249601088403018&amp;ref_query=merge" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>But the good thing is going forward, you will not have the trouble of handling 2 different pages or accounts, and make sure all your fans are available at one common official page. This way you will cash in on effective <a title="Social Media Optimization" href="http://www.niyati.com/social-media-optimization.htm">social media optimization</a> by not only chasing one hare, but catching it too.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>QR Codes have caught the fancy of advertisers in the recent past. Starting from Ford introducing it to view the Figo video to Levis Jeans, Infosys, Platinum Guild and many more, that small little square arrangement of black and white dots are becoming a lot trendier. The recently launched GRT Jewellers Golden Seed campaign rings in the New Year with customized designer QR Code – a step ahead of the normal black and white QR codes that you have seen until recently.</p>
<p>It is the first of custom designer QR codes adopted in retail advertising and probably the first in the country. Targeted at Smartphone users with any QR Reader installed in their phones, each scan led the user to a microsite with a call-to-action. What’s important to note is that although this is targeted at a niche audience, advertisers must try and leverage best practices to make QR codes successful.</p>
<div class="p_embed p_image_embed"><img alt="goldenseed loomband.jpg.scaled500 Making best use of Designer QR Codes" src="http://getfile0.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2012-01-04/wAqbskadtlhHqxrhDjikpwJqBaiAHogHIJdqlpxwpIlxxegllgjCnlAoAeba/goldenseed-loomband.jpg.scaled500.jpg" width="500" height="575" title="Making best use of Designer QR Codes" /></div>
<p>Here are a few tips &#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1.    Enhance Brand Equity: </strong><br /> QR Codes can be more than just black and white squares and dots. You can make smart use of spaces to integrate your brand identity and win over your customers. Beautiful, rich, smart and trendy QR Codes can give your brand a facelift and also paint the picture of a savvy business. What better way to reach out to your audience in a 2cm x 2cm graphic advertisement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="p_embed p_image_embed"><img alt="Rangde.jpg.scaled500 Making best use of Designer QR Codes" src="http://getfile6.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2012-01-04/GHirkFCEDhjFdcfxxulpFBJkyIlIIujzjoanewCadJphqayyFbhnGnBcvfEn/Rangde.jpg.scaled500.jpg" width="198" height="198" title="Making best use of Designer QR Codes" /></div>
<p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><em>(Designer QR Code for Rangde.org &#8211; leads you to their website)</em></span></p>
<p><strong>2.    Ensure 360º Visibility:</strong><br /> The easiest way to let customers know about your QR code are through your regular print advertisements. But then you can also have it at any point-of-sale within your store by way of posters and outdoor media through hoardings, banners and even product packaging. If you do email marketing, online advertising and are active on social media networks, you could milk the most of these media to let the audience scan your QR code. The chances of QR scans by customers online are even more and sharing becomes easier.</p>
<p><strong>What’s in the QR Code is more important than how it looks?</strong> Most QR Codes allow you to embed an URL (which can eventually lead to a website, video, image or blog), a Text message or a Phone Number.</p>
<p>We recommend going that extra mile to make the scan worthwhile. Going by the conventional advertising adage &#8211; there are a few smart things you can do to make that QR Code attract attention, create desire and trigger an action.</p>
<p><strong>3.    Link to a Microsite :</strong><br /> Perhaps the best way to offer more information on your product and/or service is to provide a link to an URL that could be campaign specific information. Linking it to a video commercial that is already on air on popular channels might be a waste of the medium. Unless of course, if your media planner has saved you a few lakh rupees and kept your video embedded on your microsite or on YouTube. Like every good search engine marketer, we also bet on microsites that have lead generation forms to capture contact details of your customer.</p>
<div class="p_embed p_image_embed"><img alt="sunban qr designer.jpg.scaled500 Making best use of Designer QR Codes" src="http://getfile7.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2012-01-04/EkDIcFGDHADsICvEjBmuBzAemftzjyHAchjBhhojEysCtdGwGyIjEbywvqHA/sunban-qr-designer.jpg.scaled500.jpg" width="198" height="198" title="Making best use of Designer QR Codes" /></div>
<p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><em>(Designer QR Code for Saint-Gobain Sun Ban Glass)</em></span></p>
<p><strong>4.    Offer a Promo Code :</strong><br /> If you have an e-commerce site or are running a sale at your retail outlet, it is a good idea to offer a promo code that could give them either a price or a percentage discount. Customers see the promo code after scanning the QR Code and can enter it while they checkout of the shopping cart online, or while they purchase off-the-shelf. This way you ensure sales and your cash registers ringing.</p>
<p><strong>5.    Make use of SMS Short Codes :</strong><br /> You can make use of SMS Short Code services to embed key pull messages from your customers. There are also options where you can trigger an SMS to be sent to the Customer’s mobile number. The desired objective is to capture the contact information of the customers scanning the QR Code and then having your sales staff follow-up with them.</p>
<p>It doesn’t end here. Go one step further to analyse the performance of your QR Code.</p>
<p><strong>6.    Measure Scans:</strong><br /> Make use of analytics to review the number of scans on a daily basis and the region from where you are getting the most number of scans. This can be a little tricky because most analytics default it to the gateway of the telecom service provider. So a Vodafone user in Chennai might always show up as Bangalore or Mumbai. This makes it redundant, but then comparing your scans with the amount of conversions you clock daily will give you a fair idea about the performance. These metrics provide a guided mechanism to plan your advertising and marketing spends.</p>
<p><strong>7.    Improvise Campaigns:</strong><br /> Once you start seeing the results, improvise on your campaign with newer schemes and promotions. Like every business, innovation is key. Innovate on your offers and innovate on your QR codes. Touch wood, your QR codes can have customers queue up at your store – be it offline or online.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="p_embed p_image_embed"><img alt="Acme2.jpg.scaled500 Making best use of Designer QR Codes" src="http://getfile3.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2012-01-04/mfFuEhsbpcwhnbhGIqHJwEAhiGdoeGkfwzwCtofubbBtJxqAfclvBDhtvhFv/Acme2.jpg.scaled500.jpg" width="295" height="295" title="Making best use of Designer QR Codes" /></div>
<p><em><span style="font-size: x-small;">(Designer QR Code for Acme Fitness &#8211; leading to the TRUE Fitness Campaign)</span></em></p>
<p>Albeit new to a desired Indian Target audience, the marketer must remember that the smartphone users are much lesser compared to the mobile phone users. And then the number of smartphone users who have a built-in QR scanner (in their smartphone or tablet) and those who know how to use them are relatively lesser. But the interesting and the promising fact is that, this is set to grow in the coming years. And with mobile commerce picking up, what better way to make a sale than by just scanning the QR Code.</p>
<p>The GRT Golden Seed Campaign with its Lotus QR Code was developed by <a title="Designer QR Codes from Niyati" href="http://www.niyati.com" target="_blank">Niyati</a> and integrates Analytics to not only measure the number of scans of the QR Code but also the conversions that happened at the microsite. This may be India’s first attempt at designer QR Codes by a Retail Jeweller and we are happy to be connected with a niche smartphone audience and grab their attention.
