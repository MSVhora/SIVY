<p>It wasn’t a CSR initiative per se. Rather a small gesture to support a great idea – Class IX students teach English to Class V students through Phonics. Titled HeadStart – this initiative by Vidyarambam Trust handpicked a few 100 students through an English Proficiency Test and then trained them on the use of phonemes. These students (who are called young teachers) in turn impart their learning to students of Class V. Niyati is privileged to be a part of this initiative and support Vidyarambam Trust in promoting this program.</p>
<div id="attachment_1517" style="width: 674px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1517" alt="Pradeep with kids from Vidyarambam A head start to HeadStart!" src="http://www.niyati.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Pradeep-with-kids-from-Vidyarambam.jpg" width="664" height="493" title="A head start to HeadStart!" /><p class="wp-caption-text">K Pradeep with kids from the Vidyarambam School</p></div>
<p>Every one of us at Niyati decided to sponsor 2 students (it just takes Rs.200 per child) and we also designed and developed the promotion video for the launch of the Program apart from other design collateral. This <a title="Whiteboard movie" href="http://www.niyati.com/multimedia-portfolio" target="_blank">whiteboard animation</a> style video, also known as video scribing, was scripted, illustrated and animated in-house. The style used was to help the viewers evangelize the mission of the program and make the message more loud and clear. The Traditional chalk and board method used was to bring in  village schools into focus. Let us know what you think. And yes, do drop by the website of <a title="Vidyarambam Trust" href="http://www.vidyarambam.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vidyarambam Trust</a> to show us your support as well.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ever since we first saw a <a title="whiteboard animation" href="http://www.niyati.com/explainer-videos.htm">whiteboard animation</a> on YouTube, we always wanted to acquire the skill to create animations of similar kind. And finally, here we are, fully equipped with the techniques and infrastructure to develop whiteboard animations in-house!</p>
<p>Unlike a flash based animation which can be done with individual or multiple animators sitting in their own comfort zones, a whiteboard animation is all about hands-on effort by the entire team. The scriptwriter, illustrator, cameraman and post-processing crew has to work in perfect sync to deliver the best results. </p>
<p>Here are the basic requisites to develop a whiteboard animation (also known as &#8216;video scribing&#8217;:</p>
<ul>
<li>A creative copywriter who can think visually </li>
<li>Story boarding artist</li>
<li>A team of excellent illustrators</li>
<li>Great voice talents &#8211; either internal or an external artist</li>
<li>Custom music or stock music clips</li>
<li>A good quality camera (we use a Canon EOS 5D Mark II) and cameraman  </li>
<li>Tripod, lighting and a glare-free whiteboard</li>
<li>Loads of patience</li>
</ul>
<p>Our first commercial whiteboard animation project is currently underway. In the meanwhile, here&#8217;s a short clip which we quickly came up with.</p>
