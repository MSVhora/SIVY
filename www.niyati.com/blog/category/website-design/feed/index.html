<p><a title="Eco Leaf Plates" href="http://ecoleafplates.com" target="_blank">Magnus Eco Concepts</a> is a manufacturer of biodegradable, eco-friendly, areca leaf crockery. They have perfected the manufacturing process of these products right from procuring the leaf sheaths in a sustainable way to manufacturing the products that meet international standards. </p>
<p>With more and more people wanting to have a positive impact on the environment, many businesses and individuals look to source eco-friendly biodegradable products for their needs. They have been a successful business with a dedicated clientele.</p>
<p>Niyati has been their online partner for sometime. To maximize the benefit of their internet presence, we recently redesigned their website using Magento as the <a title="E-commerce" href="http://www.niyati.com/e-commerce-services.htm" target="_blank">ecommerce</a> platform. The Magnus website now offers seamless and efficient online customer experience. The product photography was also handled by our in-house team.</p>

<p>When does recycling become an act of love? When you give away stuff you own to someone who can really use it. </p>
<p>As part of Shaastra, the reputed annual tech fest at IIT Madras, Niyati helped build the <a title="Pledge A Book Website" href="http://www.pledgeabook-shaastra.org" target="_blank">website for Pledge-a-book</a> campaign, a social initiative from the students at IIT Madras, that helped collect books from patrons to be given to those with limited access to learning resources. </p>
<p>Niyati is proud to be associated with the campaign that propagates the power of learning. After all, promoting continuous learning is what we at Niyati hold close to our hearts.</p>
<p>When a group of young enterprising students from the great institution approached us with their plan to take their year old campaign to the digital medium, we opted in and offered our services pro bono!</p>

<p>Across South East Asia, one in 12 adults is a diabetic. One in two people with Diabetes do not know they have it. In the year 2014, a total of 4.9 million deaths worldwide have been attributed to the disease. According to the  International Diabetic Federation, India ranks first in the top 5 South East Asian countries for the number of people with diabetes in the adult age group. Recent studies by the Madras Diabetic Research Foundation have indicated that the prevalence of diabetes has increased in the metros of Chennai and Delhi.</p>
<p>Talk about timely interventions. Thanks to the aspiration of two enterprising NRI couples from Canada, you can now access holistic diabetes prevention, education and self management care through Diasem in Chennai.</p>
<p>Niyati was commissioned to design and develop a <a title="medical website" href="http://www.niyati.com/medical-website-design.htm">medical website</a> tailored to the specifications of our client using WordPress as the CMS. The website has been developed in a responsive framework for optimal viewing experience on your mobile devices.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="Tresence" href="http://www.tresence.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1508" alt="cafe website design Café Website Design   Tresence" src="http://www.niyati.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/cafe-website-design.jpg" width="664" height="493" title="Café Website Design   Tresence" /></a></p>
<p>Everybody would love to chill, relax and hangout with friends or family, and what other better place than a café! One of our recent projects was to do branding as well as designing a website for a newly launched café chain, with it&#8217;s first outlet at Accra, Ghana. It is one of its kind in Ghana where you have a unique self serve frozen yogurt /weigh and pay concept.</p>
<p>Our first challenge was to come up with an apt name for the café. As the intrinsic nature of this café is to provide quality natural food, we came up with the name Tresence – the short for True Essence.</p>
<p>To define the rich, natural and fresh menu items, a combination of purple and brown color was used in the logo and website. The <a title="Tresence" href="http://www.tresence.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">website</a> is built on <a title="WordPress Website" href="http://www.niyati.com/wordpress-web-design.htm">WordPress Platform</a> and despite being simple, it effectively communicates its concept very well to all the foodies out there.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the exciting projects we recently completed is an extensive branding exercise for Asian Art Gallery, a newly formed organization aimed at promoting artists of Indian origin among art lovers in US and other parts of the world. </p>
<p>We worked closely with the client and came up with several creative brand identity design ideas, which went through a few rounds of iterations. The final logo uses minimalist design elements with a elegant and neat typography.  </p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1345" alt="art gallery branding Branding Services for Asian Art Gallery" src="http://www.niyati.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/art-gallery-branding.jpg" width="664" height="268" title="Branding Services for Asian Art Gallery" /></p>
<p>Apart from the logo design, we also came up with design templates for their print collateral, some of which are listed below. </p>
<p>Business card, Letterhead and Envelop designs:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1346" alt="art gallery collaterals 1 Branding Services for Asian Art Gallery" src="http://www.niyati.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/art-gallery-collaterals-1.jpg" width="664" height="650" title="Branding Services for Asian Art Gallery" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Authenticity Certificate design:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1347" alt="art gallery collaterals 2 Branding Services for Asian Art Gallery" src="http://www.niyati.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/art-gallery-collaterals-2.jpg" width="664" height="650" title="Branding Services for Asian Art Gallery" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Invite design:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a title="Asian Art Gallery Website" href="http://www.asianartgallery.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">website</a> we developed has picture galleries and brief bio of the artists participating in their latest art exhibition. The CMS powered website is developed in a <a title="responsive design" href="http://www.niyati.com/responsive-web-design.htm">responsive framework</a> so that it loads seamlessly across desktop, mobile and tablet browsers.</p>

<p>Chennai&#8217;s newest Western Music School &#8211; Academy of Western Music has a cool new website. Yet another enterprising initiative from the Nippon Group, who also owns the Yamaha Music Square showroom, the Academy aims to offer world-class music education and certification from Trinity College, London. For those who love Rock, the Academy has specialized courses on Rock Syllabus by the International Rock Music Exam Board &#8211; RockSchool.</p>
<p>When the Academy approached Niyati.com for its official website design, we recommended to go in for a <a title="Responsive Web Design, India" href="http://www.niyati.com/responsive-web-design.htm" target="_blank">Responsive Design</a> to make the website device agnostic. We knew that designing for mobile was an important step in building a brand presence online. As today&#8217;s generation have access to the latest smart phones and spend a considerable amount of time going social on their mobile, we believed that the website needs to adapt easily to smart phones as much as it does to tablets and PCs. The Responsive Web Design Team at Niyati had to go through several rounds of code checks and iterations testing it across iOS and Android Phones, as well as on iPad. But all the hardwork and efforts paid off with the end result &#8211; <a title="Academy of Western Music, Chennai" href="http://www.awmchennai.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.awmchennai.com</a></p>
<p>So folks who are keen to learn music within a world-class ambience, and with access to the latest music instruments and experienced tutors, may we recommend you to visit the Academy of Western Music at Santhome, Chennai. And yes, do check them out by logging on to their website on your phone.</p>
