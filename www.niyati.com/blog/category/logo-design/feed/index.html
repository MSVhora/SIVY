				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the exciting projects we recently completed is an extensive branding exercise for Asian Art Gallery, a newly formed organization aimed at promoting artists of Indian origin among art lovers in US and other parts of the world. </p>
<p>We worked closely with the client and came up with several creative brand identity design ideas, which went through a few rounds of iterations. The final logo uses minimalist design elements with a elegant and neat typography.  </p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1345" alt="art gallery branding Branding Services for Asian Art Gallery" src="http://www.niyati.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/art-gallery-branding.jpg" width="664" height="268" title="Branding Services for Asian Art Gallery" /></p>
<p>Apart from the logo design, we also came up with design templates for their print collateral, some of which are listed below. </p>
<p>Business card, Letterhead and Envelop designs:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1346" alt="art gallery collaterals 1 Branding Services for Asian Art Gallery" src="http://www.niyati.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/art-gallery-collaterals-1.jpg" width="664" height="650" title="Branding Services for Asian Art Gallery" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Authenticity Certificate design:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1347" alt="art gallery collaterals 2 Branding Services for Asian Art Gallery" src="http://www.niyati.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/art-gallery-collaterals-2.jpg" width="664" height="650" title="Branding Services for Asian Art Gallery" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Invite design:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1348" alt="art gallery collaterals 3 Branding Services for Asian Art Gallery" src="http://www.niyati.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/art-gallery-collaterals-3.jpg" width="664" height="650" title="Branding Services for Asian Art Gallery" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a title="Asian Art Gallery Website" href="http://www.asianartgallery.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">website</a> we developed has picture galleries and brief bio of the artists participating in their latest art exhibition. The CMS powered website is developed in a <a title="responsive design" href="http://www.niyati.com/responsive-web-design.htm">responsive framework</a> so that it loads seamlessly across desktop, mobile and tablet browsers.</p>
