<p>Welcome to ‘Digital Roundup’, a weekly roundup of the happenings in the digital world. This week’s roundup centers on the dynamic world of technology and the innovations witnessed in it. Be it Apple’s new affinity towards large screens or Google’s new Chromecast dongle, last week’s happenings promise a step ahead in the ever changing technology sphere. Here is a roundup of the biggest events in last week’s digital world.</p>
<p><b>Google Chromecast Unveiled</b></p>
<p><img class="wp-image-1196 alignright" alt="chromecast Digital Roundup – July 22 27, 2013" src="http://www.niyati.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/chromecast.jpg" width="114" height="152" title="Digital Roundup – July 22 27, 2013" />Google launched the <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/chromecast/#netflix" target="_blank">Chromecast</a>, which is expected to revolutionize the world of media streaming. The Google Chromecast is a simple adapter that can be plugged into the HDMI port of a television. Once plugged in and installed, the digital dongle is ready to connect to WiFi and bring all the streaming content that the web has to offer. The Chromecast runs on Chrome OS but it is compatible with devices running on other platforms like Android, iOS and Google Chrome on Windows etc. </p>
<p>This device is priced only $35 for the US market. As an introductory offer, the Chromecast was originally unveiled with a 3 month free subscription to Netflix. The overwhelming demand for Chromecast since its launch has prompted <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/google-shuts-down-chromecasts-free-netflix-offer-after-overwhelming-demand-6C10760643" target="_blank">Google to call off Netflix offer</a>. However, customers who ordered Chromecast before the cancellation of Netflix offer can still get access to the 3-month free subscription.</p>
<p><b>New Version of Nexus 7 Launched</b></p>
<p>An upgraded version of <a href="http://www.knowyourmobile.com/google/google-nexus-7-2/20809/new-nexus-7-and-android-43-officially-launched" target="_blank">Google’s Nexus 7</a> device has been launched on July 24, 2013. The Nexus 7 is already in existence and Google developed it in partnership with Asus. This upgraded device is all set to feature the new version of Android – 4.3 (still Jelly Bean). Some of the key features available in this device include full HD resolution, 2 GB RAM, 1.5 GHz quad core processor and multiple variations of internal memory.</p>
<p><b>Tablet Sales Reach Record High</b></p>
<p>Tablet sales have reached record high in India with the Manufacturers’ Association for Information Technology (MAIT) <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/Tablet-sales-jump-over-400-while-desktops-stay-flat/articleshow/21321627.cms?" target="_blank">reporting over 400% increase</a> in the last one year. The data showed that the tablet sales for 2011-12 fiscal year was at 3.6 lakh units and it increased to 19 lakh units during the 2012-13 fiscal year.</p>

<p><b>Apple Testing Larger Screens for New Devices</b></p>
<p>Technology giant Apple is reportedly <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323829104578620870597408176.html" target="_blank">testing larger screens</a> for its smartphones and tablets. This is based on the information from Apple’s suppliers. The suppliers say that the Cupertino based company asked for smartphone screens, which are larger than the current iPhone 5 screen.</p>
<p>This move comes as a bid to compete with rivals like Samsung that have exploited the larger screens to their advantage. The research phase is quite usual with Apple and anything conclusive can be determined only after its official announcement.</p>
<p>These are some of the biggest tech news for this week. Let’s hope the next week is as cheerful as this one.</p>
