				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Niyati recently worked on the Naming and Logo design for newly started real estate company. The brief was to develop a name that is simple to pronounce, has a down-to-earth feel and yet sound classy. The client also wanted the name to have .com domain extension.</p>
<p>Our team took this as a challenge and came up with several beautiful name options. The client chose the name &#8216;Shrevin&#8217; from the very first set. Shrevin means divine in Sanskrit. We also designed the the logo and branding collateral for the company.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the exciting projects we handled recently was the <a title="Naming" href="http://www.niyati.com/brand-naming.htm" target="_blank">naming</a> and <a title="Branding" href="http://www.niyati.com/logo-design.htm" target="_blank">logo design</a> for an upcoming international beauty brand from South Korea. The brief was to coin a short name which symbolized femininity and extolled the product virtues. After few rounds of iterations, we came up with &#8216;Evelov&#8217;, which is short for Eve and Love (or, <em>what woman loves</em>!). The name also anagrams to &#8216;evolve&#8217;, which is one of the product traits. We developed the logo with simple, clean typography and minimalist elements to it.</p>
