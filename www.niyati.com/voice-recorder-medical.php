                  <h4>Create a Mobile App that allows doctors to dictate medical
                    records and auto-transfer them to a centralized server
                    without the need for manual uploads.</h4>
                  <br>
                  The current dictation tools on the stores allowed limited (up
                  to 10 minutes) voice-notes recording with no facility to
                  transfer files for further transcription. Time was lost in
                  uploading and downloading of audio files resulting in huge
                  costs for the transcription agency. <br>

                in understanding the current pain-points of the medical
                transcription process, and the challenges the doctors faced. The
                <a href="mobile-app-development.html">mobile app</a> solution was
                developed to accommodate larger duration of voice-notes
                recording (up to 30 minutes), auto-saving them on the local
                device and auto-transfering the file to a centralized server. <br>
                <br>
                A customized back office administration tool was developed for
                the agency to track new audio files and process the same for
                further transcription. The tool checked for newly updated and
                edited audio files. Doctors had the freedom to also edit a
                previously sent voice note directly on the mobile app. </div>
