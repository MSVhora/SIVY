                <h4>Search Engine Optimization</h4>
                <h1>The what, why and how</h1>
                In simple terms Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is a practice
                by which a website is optimized to rank higher for specific
                keywords and phrases in leading search engines like Google,
                Yahoo or Bing. It is a systematic process whereby several
                on-site and off-site factors are worked upon to improve natural
                (or unpaid) ranking of a website compared to millions of
                competitors.<br>
                <br>
                Search Engine Optimization is absolutely critical to any
                business that wants to make a mark on the internet. Be it an
                individual selling perfumed candles or a multinational company
                marketing high-end technology services, being on the top of
                organic search results is a decisive factor for your success
                online. <br>
                <br>
                Our experienced search engine optimization experts will take a
                very focused approach in enabling your site to be optimized for
                search engines. We have a proven multi-step process that ensures
                your website not just ranks well, but also improves the

                      techniques may show some results in the short term, but
                      can prove disastrous when a red flag is raised against
                      your website. You can lose all your ranking, or worse, get
